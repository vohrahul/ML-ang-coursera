<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
Thank you for installing GNU Octave!

<p>
Octave 4.2 is a major release with many improvements in Matlab compatibility
as well as significant cleanup of the core C++ code.
</p>
<p>
A full list of changes can be found in the Release Notes from the News menu.

<h2>BLAS Library Selection</h2>
<p>
During the installation a default BLAS library was selected. The installer
contains 2 BLAS implementations,
the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">NetLib reference BLAS</a>
and <a href="http://www.openblas.net/">OpenBLAS</a>.
</p>
<p>
The choice of library may be changed after installation by copying
either librefblas.dll or libopenblas.dll to the file libblas.dll in the bin
folder of the Octave installation.
