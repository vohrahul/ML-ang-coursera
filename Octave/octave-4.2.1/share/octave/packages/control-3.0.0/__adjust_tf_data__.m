## Common code for adjusting TF model data.

  ## NOTE: the 'tfpoly' constructor checks its vector as well,
  ##       but its error message would make little sense for users
  ##       and would make it hard for them to identify the invalid argument.

  ## NOTE: this code is nicer, but there would be conflicts in  @tf/__set__.m
  ##       e.g.  sys = tf ([5, 22], [1, 2]),  sys.num = 5
