## Determine whether @acronym{LTI} system has asymptotically stable zero dynamics.
## According to the definition of Byrnes/Isidori [1], the zeros
## of a minimum-phase system must be strictly
## inside the left complex half-plane (continuous-time case)
## or inside the unit circle (discrete-time case).
## Note that the poles are not tested.
##
## M. Zeitz [2] discusses the inconsistent definitions of the minimum-phase property
## in a German paper.  The abstract in English states the following [2]:
## 
## Originally, the minimum phase property has been defined by H. W. Bode [3]
## in order to characterize the unique relationship between gain and phase of
## the frequency response.
## With regard to the design of digital filters, another definition of minimum
## phase is used and a filter is said to be minimum phase if both the filter
## and its inverse are asymptotically stable.
## Finally, systems with asymptotically stable zero dynamics are named as
## minimum phase by C. I. Byrnes and A. Isidori [1].
## Due to the inconsistent definitions, avoiding the minimum phase property
## for control purposes is advocated and the well-established criteria of
## Hurwitz or Ljapunow to describe the stability of filters and zero dynamics
## are recommended.

## True if the system is minimum-phase and false otherwise.
