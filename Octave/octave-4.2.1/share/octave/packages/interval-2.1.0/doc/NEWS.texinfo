@center Summary of important user-visible changes

@release{2.1.0, 2016-12-28}
@itemize
@item
	The speed of some arithmetic operations has been greatly improved.  They have previously been computed by multi-precision arithmetic which simulates binary64 floating-point arithmetic (MPFR library).  Now, a specialized correctly rounded mathematical library (crlibm) computes identical results 30–100 times faster.  There is no accuracy drawback, arithmetic operations will compute tight interval enclosures as before.  The following functions benefit from this: acos, asin, atan, cos, cosh, exp, expm1, log, log10, log1p, log2, sin, sinh, tan.

@release{2.0.0, 2016-11-20}
This major release contains fundamental changes to the interval constructors.  After a discussion on the P1788 mailing list, it has been revealed that this interval package didn't implement exceptions from the standard for interval arithmetic correctly: Operations from IEEE Std 1788-2015 which trigger an “exception” shall return a value nonetheless.  Conformance has been improved in this new version, but may break compatibility with previous versions.

A second big news is that the interval package comprises functions from VERSOFT, a verification software package by Jiří Rohn, who has generously published his work as free software this year.  Unfortunately, some of VERSOFT's functions are encrypted and could not be included yet.

@itemize
@item
    nai: With additional arguments, matrices of NaI (not an interval) values can be constructed.  Previously, NaI has been restricted to be of scalar value.

@item
    infsup: The bare interval constructor merely triggers a warning instead of an error on illegal input, which creates empty intervals.  If input contains legitimate as well as illegal input, only entries with illegal input will carry empty intervals.

@item
    infsupdec: The decorated interval constructor may create interval matrices which have NaI (not an interval) as entries.  If input contains legitimate as well as illegal input, only entries with illegal input will carry NaI values.

@item
    Warning and error identifiers of the constructors have been revised.
    
    The warning identifier @code{interval:NaI} has been removed.  Illegal input signals an @code{interval:UndefinedOperation} warning.  If the input is of an illegal data type or of illegal size, the constructors signal an @code{interval:InvalidOperand} warning.
    
    The warning identifier @code{interval:PossiblyUndefinedOperation} has been renamed to @code{interval:PossiblyUndefined} to better match the wording in the standard document. Also, previous versions failed to trigger this warning in cases where there is a floating point number between boundaries @var{u} < @var{l}, which has been fixed.

@item
    It is no longer valid to call @code{infsup (+inf, -inf)} to create an empty interval and the constructor will signal a warning in these cases.  This change has been made to better conform to the @command{numsToInterval} function from the interval standard.
    
    You may create empty intervals with either @code{infsup ()} or @code{infsupdec ()} or @code{empty ()}.

@item
    inf, sup: If the input is NaI (not an interval), these functions return NaN (not a number) values instead of an error.

@item
    Output of intervals in hexadecimal form discriminates between subnormal boundaries and normal boundaries.  Subnormal numbers start with “0x0.” whereas normal numbers start with “0x1.”.
    
    Also, hexadecimal form has been changed to lower case.

@item
    resize: New interval elements are initialized with zero instead of empty intervals to better match the corresponding Octave function.

@item
    Interval constructors may broadcast column and row vectors.

@item
    Performance improvements: factorial on large arguments; plot and plot3 on input that is plotted as a line.

@item
    New interval functions: tril, triu, qr

@item
    New functions which have been ported from Jiří Rohn's VERSOFT: chol, vereigback, vereigvec, verintlinineqs, verinvnonneg, verlinineqnn, verlinprog

@item
    recip, sqr: The functions have been removed, after they have been deprecated in version 1.4.0.

@item
    plot3: Fixed plotting with gnuplot and fixed an issue where the figure did not switch from 2D to 3D after plotting.

@item
    expm1: Fixed documentation, the function computes exp (X) - 1 instead of exp (X - 1).

@item
    norm: Fixed an error where the Hamming norm of empty intervals was non-empty.

@end itemize

@release{1.3.0, 2015-12-22}
@itemize
@item postpad, prepad, subsasgn: Implicit new elements during subscript assignment and padding have been initialized with empty intervals before this release.  This behavior has changed.

Also it is possible to use @command{format hex}.  The old format can be accessed with the @command{intervaltotext} function.
