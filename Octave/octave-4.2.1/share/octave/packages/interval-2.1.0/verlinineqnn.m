## @deftypefun {[@var{x}, @var{y}] =} verlinineqnn (@var{A}, @var{b})
## Verified nonnegative solution of a system of linear inequalities.
##
## For a rectangular real matrix @var{A} and a matching real vector @var{b},
## this function either computes a verified solution of the system of linear
## inequalities
## @display
## @var{A} * @var{x} @leq{} b, @*
##           @var{x} @geq{} 0,
## @end display
## or verifies nonexistence of a solution, or yields no verified result.
##
## Possible outputs:
## @itemize @bullet
## @item
## Either @var{x} is a real vector verified to satisfy both inequalities and
## @var{y} is a vector of NaN's,
## 
## @item
## or @var{y} is a real vector verified to satisfy
## @display
## @var{A}' * @var{y} @geq{} 0, @*
##            @var{y} @geq{} 0, @*
## @var{b}' * @var{y} @leq{} -1
## @end display
## (which by Farka's lemma implies nonexistence of a solution to the original
## inequalities), and @var{x} is a vector of NaN's,
##
## @item
## or both @var{x} and @var{y} are NaN's. In this case no verified result could
## be found.
