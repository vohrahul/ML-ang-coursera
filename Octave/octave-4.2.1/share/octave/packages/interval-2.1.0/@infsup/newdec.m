## 
## Create a decorated interval from a bare interval.
##
## The decorated interval will carry the best possible decoration, i. e.,
## @code{trv} for empty intervals, @code{dac} for unbound intervals, and
## @code{com} for common intervals.
##
## If @var{X} already is decorated, nothing happens.  In particular, the
## decoration will not be changed in order to not lose any information.
##
## @example
## @group
## newdec (infsup (2, 3))
##   @result{} ans = [2, 3]_com
## @end group
## @end example
