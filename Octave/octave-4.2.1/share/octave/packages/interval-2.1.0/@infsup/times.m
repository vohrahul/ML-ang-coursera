## At least one case of interval multiplication is complicated: when zero is an
## inner point of both interval factors.  In all other cases it would suffice
## to compute a single product for each product boundary.
##
## It is not significandly faster to do a case by case analysis in order to
## save some calls to the times function with directed rounding. Therefore, we
## simply compute the product for each pair of boundaries where the min/max
## could be located.
