## @defmethod {@@infsup} iscommoninterval (@var{X})
## 
## Check if the interval is a common interval, that is a nonemty, closed
## bounded real interval.
##
## Common intervals are used in class Moore interval arithmetic and are
## flavor-independent in IEEE Std 1788-2015 interval arithmetic.
##
## Evaluated on interval matrices, this functions is applied element-wise.
