## @defmethod {@@infsup} rsqrt (@var{X})
## 
## Compute the reciprocal square root (for all positive numbers).
##
## Accuracy: The result is a tight enclosure.
##
## @example
## @group
## rsqrt (infsup (-6, 4))
##   @result{} ans = [0.5, Inf]

%!# from the documentation string

%!# correct use of signed zeros
