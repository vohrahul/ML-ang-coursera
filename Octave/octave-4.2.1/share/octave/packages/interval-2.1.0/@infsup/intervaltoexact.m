## 
## Build an exact representation of the interval @var{X} in
## hexadecimal-significand form.
##
## The interval boundaries are stored in binary floating point format and can
## be converted to hexadecimal format without precision loss.
##
## The equation @code{@var{X} == exacttointerval (intervaltoexact (@var{X}))}
## holds for all intervals @var{X}.
##
## Accuracy: The output is exact.
