## @defmethod {@@infsup} disjoint (@var{A}, @var{B})
## 
## Evaluate disjoint comparison on intervals.
##
## True, if all numbers from @var{A} are not contained in @var{B} and vice
## versa.  False, if @var{A} and @var{B} have at least one element in common.
##
## Evaluated on interval matrices, this functions is applied element-wise.
