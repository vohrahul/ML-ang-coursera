## @defmethod {@@infsup} sqrt (@var{X})
## 
## Compute the square root (for all non-negative numbers).
##
## Since intervals are only defined for real numbers, this function and
## @code{realsqrt} are equivalent.
##
## Accuracy: The result is a tight enclosure.
##
## @example
## @group
## sqrt (infsup (-6, 4))
##   @result{} ans = [0, 2]
## @end group
## @end example
