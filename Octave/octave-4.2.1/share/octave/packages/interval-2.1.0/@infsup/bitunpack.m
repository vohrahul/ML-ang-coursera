## The result is a raw bit pattern of length 128 that derive from two binary64
## numbers.  Bits are in increasing order.  Byte order depends on the system's
## endianness.  First 8 bytes come from the lower interval boundary, last
## 8 bytes come from the upper interval boundary.
##
## The result is a row vector if @var{X} is a row vector; otherwise, it is a
## column vector.
##
## For all scalar intervals the following equation holds:
## @code{@var{X} == interval_bitpack (bitunpack (@var{X}))}.
