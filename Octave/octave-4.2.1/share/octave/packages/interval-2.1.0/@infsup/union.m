## 
## Build the interval hull of the union of intervals.
##
## With two arguments the union is built pair-wise.  Otherwise the union is
## computed for all interval members along dimension @var{DIM}, which defaults
## to the first non-singleton dimension.
##
## Accuracy: The result is exact.
##
## @example
## @group
## x = infsup (1, 3);
## y = infsup (2, 4);
## union (x, y)
##   @result{} ans = [1, 4]
## @end group
