## 
## Compute the signed distance between two intervals as sets.
##
## The signed distance for closed real intervals is the minimum distance
## between each pair of numbers, where the result's sign indicates whether
## @var{x} precedes @var{y} (negative), @var{y} precedes @var{x} (positive), or
## @var{x} intersects @var{y} (zero).  That is, the signed distance equals zero
## if a number can be found in both intervals.  Otherwise the signed distance
## is the positive or negative size of the gap between both intervals on the
## real number lane.
##
## If any interval is empty, the result is NaN.  For interval matrices the
## result is computed entry-wise.
##
## Accuracy: The result is correctly-rounded (away from zero).
##
## @example
## @group
## sdist (infsup (0, 6), infsup (7, 20))
##   @result{} ans =  -1
## sdist (infsup (3, 5), infsup (0, 1))
##   @result{} ans =  2
## @end group
