## @defmethod {@@infsup} factorial (@var{N})
## 
## Compute the factorial of @var{N} where @var{N} is a non-negative integer.
##
## If @var{N} is a scalar, this is equivalent to
## @display
## factorial (@var{N}) = 1 * 2 * @dots{} * @var{N}.
## @end display
## For vector or matrix arguments, return the factorial of each element in the
## array.
##
## For non-integers see the generalized factorial function @command{gamma}.
## Note that the factorial function grows large quite quickly, and the result
## cannot be represented exactly in binary64 for @var{N} ≥ 23 and will overflow
## for @var{N} ≥ 171.
##
## Accuracy: The result is a tight enclosure.
##
## @example
## @group
## factorial (infsup (6))
##   @result{} ans = [720]
## @end group
## @end example
