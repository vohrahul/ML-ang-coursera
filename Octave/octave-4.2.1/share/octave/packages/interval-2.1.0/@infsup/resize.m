## Resize interval matrix @var{X} cutting off elements as necessary.
##
## In the result, element with certain indices is equal to the corresponding
## element of @var{X} if the indices are within the bounds of @var{X};
## otherwise, the element is set to zero.
##
## If only @var{M} is supplied, and it is a scalar, the dimension of the result
## is @var{M}-by-@var{M}.  If @var{M} and @var{N} are all scalars, then the
## dimensions of the result are @var{M}-by-@var{N}.  If given a vector as
## input, then the dimensions of the result are given by the elements of that
## vector.
