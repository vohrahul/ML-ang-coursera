## Get the radius (and midpoint) of interval @var{X}.
##
## If @var{X} is empty, @code{rad (@var{X})} is NaN.
## If @var{X} is unbounded in one or both directions, @code{rad (@var{X})} is 
## positive infinity.
##
## With two output parameters the midpoint and radius are computed.
##
## Accuracy: The radius @var{R} will make a tight enclosure of the interval
## together with midpoint @var{M}.

## @group
## rad (infsup (2.5, 3.5))
