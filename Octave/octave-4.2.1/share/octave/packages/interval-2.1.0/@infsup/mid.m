## @defmethod {@@infsup} mid (@var{X})
## 
## Get the midpoint of interval @var{X}.
##
## If @var{X} is empty, @code{mid (@var{X})} is NaN.
## If @var{X} is entire, @code{mid (@var{X})} is 0.
## If @var{X} is unbounded in one direction, @code{mid (@var{X})} is positive
## or negative @code{realmax ()}.
##
## Accuracy: The result is rounded to the nearest floating point number and
## may thus be exact or not.  However, it is guaranteed that the interval
## @var{X} is tightly enclosed by
## @code{[mid (@var{X}) - rad (@var{X}), mid (@var{X}) + rad (@var{X})]}.
##
## @example
## @group
## mid (infsup (2.5, 3.5))
##   @result{} ans = 3
## @end group
## @end example
## @seealso{@@infsup/inf, @@infsup/sup, @@infsup/rad}
