## 
## Solve a linear interval system @var{A} * @var{x} = @var{b} using Gaussian
## elimination.
##
## The found enclosure is improved with the help of the Gauß-Seidel-method.
##
## Note: This algorithm is very inaccurate and slow for matrices of a dimension 
## greater than 3.  A better solver is provided by @code{mldivide}.  The
## inaccuracy mainly comes from the dependency problem of interval arithmetic
## during back-substitution of the solution's enclosure.
##
## Accuracy: The result is a valid enclosure.
##
## @example
## @group
## gauss (infsup ([1, 0; 0, 2]), [2, 0; 0, 4])
##   @result{} ans = 2×2 interval matrix
##      [2]   [0]
##      [0]   [2]

## x must be square

        "gauss: nonconformant arguments, X is not square");

## We have to compute z = inv (x) * y.
## This can be done by Gaußian elimination by solving the following equation
## for the variable z: x * z = y

## Step 1: Perform LUP decomposition of x into triangular matrices L, U and
##         permutation matrix P
##         P * x = L * U

[L, U, P] = lu (x);

## Step 2: Forward substitution 
##         Solve L * s = inv (P) * y

s = permute (inv (P), y);
curelement.type = prevvars.type =  "()";
for i = 1 : m
    ## Special case: k == 1
    ## s (k, i) already is correct
    for k = 2 : n
        curelement.subs = {k, i};
        prevvars.subs = {1 : k, i};
        
        varcol = subsref (s, prevvars);
        Lrow = subsref (L, substruct ("()", {k, 1 : k}));
        
        ## We have to subtract varcol (1 : (k - 1)) * Lrow (1 : (k - 1)) from
        ## s (k, i). Since varcol (k) == s (k, i), we can simply set
        ## Lrow (k) = -1 and the dot product will compute the difference for us
        ## with high accurracy.
        Lrow.inf(k) = Lrow.sup(k) = -1;
        
        ## Then, we only have to flip the sign afterwards.
        s = subsasgn (s, curelement, -dot (Lrow, varcol));
    endfor
endfor

## Step 3: Backward substitution
##         Solve U * z = s

z = s;
Urowstart.type = Urowrest.type = "()";
for i = 1 : m
    ## Special case: k == n
    curelement.subs = {n, i};
    Urowstart.subs = {n, n};
    z = subsasgn (z, curelement, ...
                  mulrev (subsref (U, Urowstart), subsref (z, curelement)));
    for k = (n - 1) : -1 : 1
        curelement.subs = {k, i};
        Urowstart.subs = {k, k};
        prevvars.subs = {k : n, i};
        Urowrest.subs = {k, k : n};
        
        varcol = subsref (z, prevvars);
        Urow = subsref (U, Urowrest);
        
        ## Use the same trick like above during forward substitution.
        Urow.inf(1) = Urow.sup(1) = -1;
        
        ## Additionally we must divide the element by the current diagonal
        ## element of U.
        z = subsasgn (z, curelement, ...
                      mulrev (subsref (U, Urowstart), -dot (Urow, varcol)));
    endfor
endfor

## Now we have solved inv (P) * L * U * z = y for z.
##
## The current result for z is only a rough estimation in general, because
## inv (P) * L * U is only an enclosure of the original linear interval
## system x * z = y and the Gaußian elimination above introduces several
## inaccuracies because of aggregated intermediate results and accumulated
## rounding errors.
##
## We can further try to improve the boundaries of the result with the original
## linear system.  This is an iterative method using the mulrev operation.  It
## is quite accurate in each step, because it only depends on one (tightest)
## dot operation and one (tightest) mulrev operation.  However, the convergence
## speed is slow and each cycle is costly, so we have to cancel after one
## iteration.
##
## The method used here is similar to the Gauß-Seidel-method.  Instead of
## diagonal elements of the matrix we use an arbitrary element that does not
## contain zero as an inner element.
