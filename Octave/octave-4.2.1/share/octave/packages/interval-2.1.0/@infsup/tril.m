## Return a new matrix formed by extracting the lower triangular part of the
## matrixÂ @var{A}, and setting all other elements to zero.
##
## The second argument is optional, and specifies how many diagonals above or
## below the main diagonal should also be set to zero.
##
## If the option @option{pack} is given as third argument, the extracted
## elements are not inserted into a matrix, but rather stacked column-wise one
## above other.
