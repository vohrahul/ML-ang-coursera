## @defmethod {@@infsupdec} nthroot (@var{X}, @var{N})
## 
## Compute the real n-th root of @var{X}.
##
## Accuracy: The result is a valid enclosure.  The result is a tight
## enclosure for @var{n} ≥ -2.  The result also is a tight enclosure if the
## reciprocal of @var{n} can be computed exactly in double-precision.
