##
## Bisect an interval into two intervals, which contain half the amount of
## binary64 numbers each.
##
## Instead of bisecting the values of numbers in the interval at
## @code{mid (@var{X})}, this function bisects a function that counts them.  In
## a bisect method this eliminates exactly half of the solutions and avoids
## slow convergence speeds in extreme cases.
##
## If all numbers in interval @var{X} are of equal sign, the pivot element used
## for bisection is @code{pow2 (mid (log2 (abs (@var{X}))))}.  If @var{X} is no
## empty interval, the intervals @var{A} and @var{B} are non-empty and satisfy
## @code{@var{A}.sup == @var{B}.inf}.
##
## @comment DO NOT SYNCHRONIZE DOCUMENTATION STRING
## The function is a set operation and the result carries the @code{trv}
## decoration at best.
##
## @example
## @group
## [a, b] = bisect (infsupdec (2, 32))
##   @result{} 
##     a = [2, 8]_trv
##     b = [8, 32]_trv
## @end group
