## @defmethod {@@infsupdec} polyval (@var{P}, @var{X})
##
## Evaluate polynomial @var{P} with argument @var{X}.
##
## Horner's scheme is used to evaluate a first approximation.  The result is
## improved with iterative refinement.
##
## Accuracy: The result is a tight enclosure for polynomials of degree 1 or
## less.  For polynomials of higher degree the result is a valid enclosure.
## For @var{X} being no singleton interval, the algorithm suffers from the
## dependency problem.
##
## @example
## @group
## output_precision (16, 'local')
## polyval (infsupdec ([3 4 2 1]), 42) # 3x^3 + 4x^2 + 2x^1 + 1 | x = 42
##   @result{} [229405]_com
## polyval (infsupdec ([3 4 2 1]), "42?") # ... | x = 41.5 .. 42.5
##   @result{} [221393.125, 237607.875]_com
