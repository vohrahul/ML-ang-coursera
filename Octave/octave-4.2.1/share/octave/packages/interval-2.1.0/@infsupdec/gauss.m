## 
## Solve a linear interval system @var{A} * @var{x} = @var{b} using Gaussian
## elimination.
##
## The found enclosure is improved with the help of the Gauß-Seidel-method.
##
## Note: This algorithm is very inaccurate and slow for matrices of a dimension 
## greater than 3.  A better solver is provided by @code{mldivide}.  The
## inaccuracy mainly comes from the dependency problem of interval arithmetic
## during back-substitution of the solution's enclosure.
##
## Accuracy: The result is a valid enclosure.
##
## @example
## @group
## gauss (infsupdec ([1, 0; 0, 2]), [2, 0; 0, 4])
##   @result{} ans = 2×2 interval matrix
##      [2]_trv   [0]_trv
##      [0]_trv   [2]_trv
## @end group
## @end example
