## 
## Mince interval @var{X} into a row vector of @var{N} sub-intervals of equal
## size.
##
## The sub-intervals are returned in ascending order and may overlap due to
## round-off errors.
##
## If @var{X} is not a scalar, the result is a matrix.  The default value for
## @var{N} is 100.
##
## Accuracy: The result is an accurate enclosure.
##
## @example
## @group
## mince (infsupdec (0, 10), 4)
##   @result{} ans = 1Ã—4 interval vector
##
##        [0, 2.5]_trv   [2.5, 5]_trv   [5, 7.5]_trv   [7.5, 10]_trv
