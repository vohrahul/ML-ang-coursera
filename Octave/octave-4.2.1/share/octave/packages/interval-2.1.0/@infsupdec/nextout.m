## 
## Increases the interval's boundaries in each direction to the next number.
##
## This is the equivalent function to IEEE 754's nextDown and nextUp.
##
## @comment DO NOT SYNCHRONIZE DOCUMENTATION STRING
## The function is a set operation and the result carries the @code{trv}
## decoration at best.
##
## @example
## @group
## x = infsupdec (1);
## nextout (x) == infsupdec (1 - eps / 2, 1 + eps)
##   @result{} ans = 1
## @end group
