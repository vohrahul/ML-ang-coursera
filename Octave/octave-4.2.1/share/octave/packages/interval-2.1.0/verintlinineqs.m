## Verified strong solution of interval linear inequalities.
##
## For a rectangular interval matrix @var{A} and a matching interval
## vector @var{b}, this function either computes a strong solution @var{x} to
## @display
## @var{A} * @var{x} @leq{} b
## @end display
## (i. e., a real vector @var{x} verified to satisfy
## @var{Ao} * @var{x} @leq{} @var{bo} for each @var{Ao} in @var{A} and @var{bo}
## in @var{b}), or verifies nonexistence of such a solution, or yields no
## verified result:
##
## @table @asis
## @item ~isnan (@var{x})
## @var{x} is a verified strong solution of @var{A} * @var{x} @leq{} @var{b},
## and @var{As} is an interval matrix of empty intervals,
##
## @item ~isempty (@var{As})
## @var{As} is a very right (“almost thin”) interval matrix verified to contain
## a real matrix @var{Ao} such that the system
## @var{Ao} * @var{x} @leq{} @var{b}.inf has no solution (which proves that no
## strong solution exists), and @var{x} is a vector of NaNs,
##
## @item otherwise
## no verified output.
## @end table
##
## A theoretical result [1] asserts that if each system
## @var{Ao} * @var{x} @leq{} @var{bo}, where @var{Ao} in @var{A} and @var{bo}
## in @var{b}, has a solution (depending generally on @var{Ao} and @var{bo}),
## then there exists a vector @var{x} satisfying
## @var{Ao} * @var{x} @leq{} @var{bo} for @emph{each} @var{Ao} in @var{A} and
## @var{bo} in @var{b}.  Such a vector @var{x} is called a strong solution of
## the system @var{A} * @var{x} @leq{} @var{b}.
