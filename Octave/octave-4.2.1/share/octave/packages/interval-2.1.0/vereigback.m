## Verified backward error analysis of eigenpairs.
##
## For a square complex (or real) matrix @var{A}, this function computes a
## vector of eigenvalues @var{lambda} and a matrix of eigenvectors @var{X}
## in the usual Octave way
## @display
## @code{[X, L] = eig (A); lambda = diag (L);}
## @end display
## and additionally a vector @var{ep} with the following property: for each
## @var{i} there exists a matrix, say @var{A}[@var{i}], verified to satisfy
## @code{max (max (abs (A - A[i]))) <= ep(i)} such that
## @code{(lambda(i), X(:, i))} is verified to be an @emph{exact} eigenpair
## of @var{A}[@var{i}].  If @var{A}, @code{lambda(i)}, and @code{X(:, i)} are
## real then @var{A}[@var{i}] can be taken real, otherwise it is complex in
## general. The maximal value of @code{ep(i)} is usually very small (of order
## 1e-013 to 1e-016), which shows that Octave computes eigenvalues and
## eigenvectors with great accuracy.
##
## Based on the inequality (3.13) in J. Rohn, A Handbook of Results on Interval
## Linear Problems, posted at @url{http://www.cs.cas.cz/~rohn}, which also
## holds for complex eigenpairs (unpublished).
