## Return the entire set of real numbers.
##
## With additional parameters, create an interval vector/matrix, which
## comprises entire interval entries.
##
## The entire set of real numbers [Entire] is a closed interval.  If used as
## an enclosure for a certain value, it represents a state of minimum
## constraints.  An interval function which evaluates to [Entire] yields no
## information at all if no interval decoration is present.
##
## The special floating-point values -Inf and Inf represent boundaries of the
## entire set of real numbers.  However, they are not members of the interval.
##
## The result of this function carries the defined and continuous @code{dac}
## decoration, which denotes that the interval is not bounded and therefore is
## no common interval.
##
## Accuracy: The representation of the entire set of real numbers is exact.
##
## @example
## @group
## x = entire ()
##   @result{} x = [Entire]_dac
## inf (x)
##   @result{} ans = -Inf
## sup (x)
##   @result{} ans = Inf
## @end group
## @end example
## @seealso{@@infsup/isentire, empty}
