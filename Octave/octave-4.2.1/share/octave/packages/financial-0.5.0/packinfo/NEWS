 ** `holidays' has been changed to include past dates where the NYSE
    was closed due to exceptional reasons.

    falls on a Saturday (Saturday holidays should be shifted to the
    previous Friday except when it crosses a calendar year).

    abbreviation of the month number. The functions, year, month, day,
    hour, minute, and second, all accept an optional input argument
    to specify the format of an input date string.

 ** The period option of `fetch' no longer accepts weekly when using
    Google as the backend (Google Finance no longer supports weekly
    historical prices).

 ** The following functions had minor bug fixes unlikely to create
    different results from previous versions:

    of the Financial package and have now been removed.

    finnance to adapt to the UTF-8 file received.
