## __JOD_getusedrange__

## Author: Philip  <prnienhuis -aT- users.sf.net>
## Created: 2010-05-25

function [ trow, brow, lcol, rcol ] = __JOD_getusedrange__ (ods, wsh)

  ## This function works for older jOpendocument (<= 1.2) by virtue of sheets
  ## in JOD actually being a Java string.
  ## It works outside of the Java memory/heap space which is an added benefit...
  ## (Read: it is one big dirty hack... prone to crash Java on BIG spreadsheets)
  ## For newer jOpenDocument 1.3b1+ there's a newer and much faster method.

  if (isnumeric (wsh))
    sh = char (ods.workbook.getSheet (wsh - 1));
  else
    sh = char (ods.workbook.getSheet (wsh));
  endif

  try
    ## Let's see if we have JOD v. 1.3x. If not, next call fails & we'll fall
    ## back to the old hack
    sh_rng = char (sh.getUsedRange ());
    if (isempty (sh_rng))
      ## Empty sheet
      trow = brow = lcol = rcol = 0;
    else
      ## Strip sheet name
      sh_rng = sh_rng(length (sh.getName) + 2 : end);
      ## Get rid of period
      sh_rng = strrep (sh_rng, ".", "");
      [~, nr, nc, trow, lcol] = parse_sp_range (sh_rng);
      brow = trow + nr - 1;
      rcol = lcol + nc - 1;
    endif
  
  catch
    ## Fall back to the old hack :-(    (now in private/ function)
    sh = char (sh);
    [trow, brow, lcol, rcol ] = __ods_get_sheet_dims__ (sh);
