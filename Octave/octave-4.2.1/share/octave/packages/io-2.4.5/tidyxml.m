## @deftypefn {} {@var{ostr} =} tidyxml (@var{istr}, @var{conv_fcn})
## Optionally convert character using the function handle in @var{conv_fcn},
## remove characters (<32 >255) from text string or cell array @var{istr}
## and return the result in @var{ostr}.
##
## tidyxml is useful for converting strings in XML that have been partly
## or wholly encoded as double-byte characters.  Such strings occur when
## dealing with a.o., spreadsheet programs reading/writing from/to 
## XML-based formats and cannot be processed by Octave as Octave doesn't
## support unicode.  For (optionally: nested) nested cell arrays tidyxml
## is called recursively and only processes cells containing text strings.
