## Create a 3D mesh representing the unit cube
##
## [V E F] = createCube
## Create a unit cube, as a polyhedra representation.
## c has the form [V E F], where V is a 8-by-3 array with vertices
## coordinates, E is a 12-by-2 array containing indices of neighbour
## vertices, and F is a 6-by-4 array containing vertices array of each
## face.
##
## [V F] = createCube;
## Returns only the vertices and the face vertex indices.
##
## MESH = createCube;
## Returns the data as a mesh structure, with fields 'vertices', 'edges'
## and 'faces'.
##
## Example
## @example
## [n e f] = createCube;
## drawMesh(n, f);
