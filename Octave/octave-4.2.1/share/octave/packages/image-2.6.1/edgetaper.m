  ## FIXME  this function is not Matlab compatible.  I have no clue what
  ##        Matlab is doing but is definitely not what they claim on the
  ##        documentation.  There are no references for the function and
  ##        the documentation is sparse and incorrect.
  ##
  ##        I have found papers that compare their method for reducing
  ##        boundary artifacts against Matlab's edgetaper but even they
  ##        do not comment it.
  ##
  ##        It an implementation of edgetaper that is close to Matlab's
  ##        documentation for the function.  If anyone has patience, please
  ##        fix this.
  ##
  ##        Some questions about it:
  ##
  ##          1. the autocorrelation of the PSF is twice the size of the PSF
  ##          but it will still be way smaller than the image.  How can it be
  ##          used to make a weighted mean between the blurred and the original
  ##          image? We pretty much split it and only use it on the borders
  ##          but looks like we end up with an image too blurred.
  ##
  ##          2. how do they blur the image? I will guess they pad the
  ##          image but how?
  ##
  ##  Note: always test this function with input as double precision
  ##        since it returns the same class as input and may hide our
  ##        differences.

  blurred = fftconvn (img, psf, "same");
  xpsf = normalized_autocorrelation (psf);

  ## The following will expand a ND matrix into a larger size
  ## repeating the center elements, e.g.,
  ##
  ##              1 2 2 2 3
  ##  1 2 3       4 5 5 5 6
  ##  4 5 6   =>  4 5 5 5 6
  ##  7 8 9       4 5 5 5 6
  ##              7 8 8 8 9

  ## note the xpsf will always have odd sizes (2*psf_size +1)
