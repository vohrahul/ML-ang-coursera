## @deftypefnx {Function File} {[@dots{}] =} imgetfile (@var{options}, @dots{})
## Open GUI dialogue to select image files.
##
## The GUI dialogue opened is exactly the same as @code{uigetfile} but uses
## recognized image file formats as file filter.  All other options from
## @code{uigetfile} are accepted.
##
## The return value @var{path} is a string with the full filepath of the
## selected file.  If the @qcode{"MultiSelect"} option is selected, then a
## cell array of strings is returned.
##
## @var{flag} is a logical value, true if there was any issue with file
## selection such as the user closing or cancelling the dialogue with selecting
## a file.  It has a value of false otherwise.
##
## @example
## [filepath, flag] = imgetfile ();
## if (flag)
##   error ("A file must be selected");
## endif
## @end example
##
## There is no guarantee that @code{imread} will be capable to read all
## files selected via this dialogue.  Possible reasons for this are:
##
## @itemize @bullet
## @item
## the filter uses all the extensions as obtained from @code{imformats}.
## This only means that a format with such extensions is registered, not
## necessarily that read or write support has been implemented;
##
## @item
## the dialogue also has a "All files (*)" filter, so a user is actually
## able to select any file;
##
## @item
## the file may be corrupt;
##
## @item
## it is the file content, and not the file extension, that defines the file
## format.  A file may have a file extension that is equal to an image file
## format and not actually be an image file.
##
## @end itemize
##
## The opposite is also true.  @code{imread} is able to guess the file
## format even when the file extension is incorrect (or even in the absence
## of a file extension).  A file that is filtered out may still be readable
## by @code{imread} or @code{imfinfo}.
##
## @seealso{imformats, uigetfile}
