## This private function is to be common to all functions that have an option
## for the interpolation method to use. For matlab compatibility, bicubic and
## bilinear are accepted which are the same as cubic and linear. This does not
## actually check if the method is valid, we leave that to interp2. The reason
## is that if interp2 implements a new method, all this functions will
## automatically work with it.

function method = interp_method (method)
  method = tolower (method);
  switch method
    case "bicubic",   method = "cubic";
    case "bilinear",  method = "linear";
    case "triangle",  method = "linear";  # interpolation kernel
  endswitch
endfunction
