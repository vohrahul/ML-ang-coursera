## Private function for functions that convert between color spaces, i.e.,
## rgb2xyz, xyz2rgb, xyz2lab, lab2xyz, rgb2lab and lab2rgb.  This reverts
## a colormap type into the same shape and class as it was in the input.
## (But setting the keep_class flag to 1 tells this function to not change
## the class back.)  The other flags are meant to come from  complementary
## private function colorspace_conversion_input_check()
