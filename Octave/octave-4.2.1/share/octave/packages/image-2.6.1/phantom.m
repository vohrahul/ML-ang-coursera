##
## A phantom is a known object (either real or purely mathematical) that is
## used for testing image reconstruction algorithms.  The Shepp-Logan phantom
## is a popular mathematical model of a cranial slice, made up of a set of
## overlaying ellipses.  This allows rigorous testing of computed tomography
## (CT) algorithms as it can be analytically transformed with the radon
## transform (see the functions @code{radon} and @code{iradon}).
##
## The phantom @var{P}, is created by overlaying ellipses as defined by the
## matrix @var{E} or one of the standard @var{model}s, in a square of size
## @var{n} by @var{n} (defaults to 256).
##
## The available standard @var{model}s (use the output argument @var{E} to
## inspect the details of the different ellipses) are:
##
## @table @asis
## @item @qcode{"Sheep-Logan"}
## This is the original Sheep-Logan model with 10 ellipses as described in
## Table 1 of @cite{Shepp, Lawrence A., and Benjamin F. Logan. "The Fourier
## reconstruction of a head section." Nuclear Science, IEEE Transactions on
## 21, no. 3 (1974): 21-43.}
##
## @item @qcode{"Modified Shepp-Logan"} (default)
## A modification of the original Shepp-Logan model to give a better contrast,
## as described in Table B.3 of @cite{Toft, Peter Aundal. "The radon
## transform-theory and implementation." PhD diss., Department of Mathematical
## Modelling, Technical University of Denmark, 1996.}
##
## @end table
##
## A 6 column matrix @var{E} can be used to generate a custom image by
## superimposing arbitrary ellipses.  Each row defines a single ellipse, with
## each column for the values of @{I, a, b, x0, y0, phi@}:
##
## @table @abbr
## @item I
##   is the additive intensity of the ellipse
##
## @item a
##    is the length of the major axis
##
## @item b
##    is the length of the minor axis
##
## @item x0
##    is the horizontal offset of the centre of the ellipse
##
## @item y0
##    is the vertical offset of the centre of the ellipse
##
## @item phi
##    is the counterclockwise rotation of the ellipse in degrees,
##    measured as the angle between the x axis and the ellipse major axis.
##
## @end table
##
## The image bounding box in the algorithm is @{[-1, -1], [1, 1]@}, so the
## values of a, b, x0, y0 should all be specified with this in mind.
##

##

## P = phantom (512);

  ## Note that the first element of this matrix, the gray value for the first
  ## ellipse (human skull), has a value of 1.0 even though the paper gives it a
  ## a value of 2.0 (see Table 1 on page 32 and Figure 1 on page 34). This
  ## change is so that the **head** intensity values appear in the range [0 1]
  ## rather than the range [1 2].
  ##
  ##    **The problem with this**
  ##
  ## The background still need an intensity value which is going to be 0. This
  ## means that we can't distinguish between the background and the ventricles
  ## (ellipse "c" and "d" whose intensities are a + b + c and a + b + d, see
  ## Figure 1) since they will have an intensity value of 0 (actually, because
  ## of machine precision the ventricules will be almost 0). But if we didn't
  ## made this change, the ** image** range would be [0 2] with all of the head
  ## details compressed in half of the display range. Also, Matlab seems to be
  ## doing the same.
