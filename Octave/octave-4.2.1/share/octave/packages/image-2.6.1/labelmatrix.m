## @deftypefn  {Function File} {} labelmatrix (@var{cc})
## Create labelled matrix from bwconncomp structure.
##
## Uses the structure as returned by the @code{bwconncomp} function to create
## a label matrix, where each individual object is assigned a positive number.
## A value of zero corresponds to the background.
##
## The class of the output matrix is dependent on the number of objects, being
## uint, uint16, uint32, or double, whichever is enough.
