## Apply function to matrix blocks
##
## Executes the function @var{func} on blocks of size @var{block_size},
## taken from the matrix @var{A}.  Both the matrix @var{A}, and the block
## can have any number of dimensions.
##
## The different blocks are organized into a matrix, each block as a
## single column, and passed as the first to the function handle
## @var{func}.  Any input arguments to @code{colfilt} after @var{func}
## are passed to @var{func} after the blocks matrix.
##
## Blocks can be of two different types as defined by the string @var{block_type}:
##
## @table @asis
## @item @qcode{"distinct"}
## Each block is completely distinct from the other, with no overlapping
## elements.  @var{func} must return a matrix of exactly the same size as
## its input.
##
## @item @qcode{"sliding"}
## Each possible block of size @var{block_size} inside @var{A} is used.
## @var{func} should act along the column dimension (be a column
## compression function) and return a vector of length equal to the
## number of columns of its input.
##
## @end table
##
## The optional argument @var{subsize} divides @var{A} into smaller pieces
## before generating the matrices with one block per column in order to
## save memory.  It is currently only accepted for @sc{Matlab} compatibility.
##
## If @var{A} is an indexed image, the second argument should be the
## string @qcode{"indexed"} so that any required padding is done correctly.
## The padding value will be 0 except for indexed images of class uint8
## and uint16.
##
## This function is mostly useful to apply moving or sliding window filter
## when @var{block_type} is "sliding".  However, for many cases, specialized
## functions perform much faster.  For the following common cases, consider
## the suggested alternatives;
##
## @table @asis
## @item moving average
## A moving average filter is equivalent to convolve with a matrix
## of @code{1/@var{N}} sized @var{block_size}, where @var{N} is the total
## number of elements in a block.  Use
## @code{convn (@var{A}, (1/@var{N}) * ones (@var{block_size}) *, "same")}
##
## @item maximum or minimum
## This is the equivalent to a dilation and erosion.  Use @code{imdilate} or
## @code{imerode}.
##
## @item any or all
## Same as dilation and erosion but with logical input.  Use @code{imdilate}
## or @code{imerode} with @code{logical (@var{A})}.
##
## @item median
## Use @code{medfilt2} if @var{A} is only 2 dimensional, and @code{ordfiltn}
## with the @code{floor (prod (@var{N}/ 2)} th element, where @var{N} is the
## total number of elements in a block (add 1 if it is an even number).
##
## @item sort or nth_element
## Use @code{ordfiltn}.
##
## @item standard deviation
## Use @code{stdfilt}.
##
## @item sum
## Use a matrix of 1 to perform convolution,
## @code{convn (@var{A}, ones (@var{block_size}), "same")}
##
## @end table

## @seealso{bestblk, blockproc, col2im, im2col, nlfilter}
## @end deftypefn

      ##      too large for Octave (see im2col documentation about the
      ##      size). May be a good idea to split it into smaller images
      ##      even if subsize is that large, so that we never go above
      ##      sizemax ().
      ##      However, this can be tricky. After splitting the image in
      ##      smaller blocks, they can't be distinct, some parts need
      ##      to overlap otherwise when we put them back together, we'll
      ##      introduce many artifacts.
