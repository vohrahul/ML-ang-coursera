## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{bands}, @var{info}] =} rasterread (@var{fname})
## Read a GIS raster file
##
## @var{fname} can be about any type of GIS raster file recognized by the
## GDAL library.  For .adf files, either the name of the subdirectory
## containing the various component files, or the name of one of those
## component files can be specified.
##
## Output argument @var{bands} is a struct, or if multiple bands were read,
## a struct array, with data of each band: data, min, max, bbox, and
## (if present for the band) a GDAL colortable (see GDAL on-line
## reference).
##
## Outpur argument @var{binfo} contains various info of the raster file:
## overall bounding box, geotransformation, projection, size, nr. of columns
## and rows, datatype, nr. of bands.
##
## rasterread.m needs the GDAL library.
