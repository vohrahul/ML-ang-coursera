Summary of important user-visible changes for mapping 1.2.1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new in mapping 1.2.1:

      rasterread
      rasterinfo
      rasterdraw
      gdalread
      wrapToPi
      wrapTo2Pi
      wrapTo180
      wrapTo360

 ** New features
      Reading GIS raster data:  A first go is provided using
      functions rasterread.m and rasterinfo.m.  Both invoke binary
      function gdalread() of which an initial version was provided
      by Shashank Khare.  rasterread.m and rasterinfo.m can read
      and return info on any raster data type that the underlying
      GDAL library can read.  As such, separate functions for e.g.,
      GeoTIFF and ArcGrid etc. are not required.
      To make use of these functions the GDAL library must be
      present on your system => GDAL is a suggested dependency.

      mapshow.m: drawing raster data is now supported.

      shapedraw.m: drawing speed of filled polygons and multipatches
      is much improved

      wrapTo180.m, wrapTo360.m, wrapToPi.m, wrapTo2Pi.m:  Provided
      by Oscar Monerris Belda and turned into their present versions
      with help of a.o., Andreas Weber
                   
 ** Bug fixes:
      shapewrite.m: correct Lat/Lon mix-up
                    update overall BoundingBox for Point type
      shaperead.m:  improve reading Nr. of parts (of Polylines/-gons)

 ** To avoid shadowing core functions rad2deg and deg2rad, these
      functions are only copied into place if Octave (< 4.2) does not
      have them.

      
Summary of important user-visible changes for mapping 1.2.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new in mapping 1.2.0:

      deg2km
      degtorad
      degrees2dm
      degrees2dms
      dm2degrees
      dms2degrees
      extractfield
      fromDegrees
      fromRadians
      geoshow
      km2deg
      km2rad
      km2nm
      km2sm
      makesymbolspec
      mapshow
      nm2km
      nm2sm
      nm2rad
      nm2deg
      radtodeg
      rad2km
      removeExtraNanSeparators
      roundn
      shapedraw
      shapeinfo
      shaperead
      shapewrite
      sm2km
      sm2nm
      sm2rad
      sm2deg
      toDegrees
      toRadians
      unitsratio
      validateLengthUnit

 ** The function `distance' has been greatly improved with more options
    including calculating the azimuth between points and support different
    angle units.

 ** The function km2deg can accept an optional radius or the name of some
    Solar System objects.

 ** Test functions for deg2rad, km2deg and rad2deg have been added.
 
 ** Functions shapeinfo, shaperead, shapewrite and shapedraw are meant to
    process ArcGIS shape files. Functions mapshow and geoshow are simple
    Matlab-compatible wrappers for shapedraw. A basic implementation of
    makesymbolspec is also present.
    For some functionality of shaperead.m, shapewrite.m and shapedraw.m 
    the Octave-Forge geometry, io and octclip packages are required.

    The shape* functions are considered experimental yet. Only projected
    data files can be drawn and several limitations apply. On the other
    hand some functionality is present that supersedes ML compatibility.
    See the help for each function.
