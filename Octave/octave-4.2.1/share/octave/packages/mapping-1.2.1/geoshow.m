## Plot a mapstruct created by shaperead.
##
## @var{shps} is the name of a geostruct created by shaperead.
## 
## Optional argument @var{clr} can be a predefined color ("k", "c", etc.), an
## RGB triplet, or a 2 X 1 column vector of RGB triplets (each row containing
## a triplet). The uppermost row will be used for points and lines, the
## lowermost row for solid shape features (not yet implemented).
