Summary of important user-visible changes for linear-algebra 2.2.2:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

** Several functions have been adapted to the new core-Octave "ismatrix"
   behavior (the latter only checks for 2D size, not class). To this
   end all input matrices are checked against the "isnumeric" function.
   The linear-algebra package is expected to still work for older Octave
   versions than 4.0.0 as this "isnumeric" check is only additional.

** nmf_* functions use inputParser from Octave 4.0.0. They won't work
   with older versions. 

** The interface of mnf_bpas has been simplified. The option 'verbose' 
   is now a swtich and it doesn't require a value. The History of the
   calculations IS stored and returned only if the 4th output argument 
   is requested.

Summary of important user-visible changes for linear-algebra 2.2.1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions is new in 2.2.1:
      vec_projection

 ** fixed bugs:
      nmf_pg doesn't use text_waitbar by default. The miscellaneous
      package is not required.

      nmf_bpas now respects the verbose option

      @blksparse/ctranspose returns a Block Sparse Matrix

      @kronprod/iscomplex.m, @kronprod/uminus.m:fixtypos

      src/CmplxGSVD.cc, src/dbleGSVD.cc: update Array constructor usage

      funm.m: fix texinfo, fix typo preventing thfm invocation where
      applicable, return real matrix when all |imaginary entries| < eps
      
      @kronprod and @blksparse subfunctions have been documented

 ** Makefile fixed to work with non-standard linker options e.g on
    Apple.

 ** The function circulant_make_matrix has been deprecated and will
    be removed from future versions of the linear-algebra package.

Summary of important user-visible changes for linear-algebra 2.2.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new in 2.2.0:

      circulant_eig     circulant_inv     circulant_make_matrix
      circulant_matrix_vector_product
      nmf_pg     nmf_bpas

 ** Package is now dependent on general (>= 1.3.0)

 ** Package is no longer automatically loaded.

Summary of important user-visible changes for linear-algebra 2.1.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new in 2.1.0:

      lobpcg  ndcovlt

 ** The following functions were removed since equivalents are now
    part of GNU octave core:

      bicg  mgorth

 ** The following functions were deprecated since equivalents are
    now part of GNU octave core:

      pgmres

 ** The function `funm' now also accepts function handles.

 ** Help text of most functions has been improved.
