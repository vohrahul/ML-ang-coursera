## @deftypefn {} {} display (@var{obj})
## Display the contents of the object @var{obj}.
##
## The Octave interpreter calls the @code{display} function whenever it needs
## to present a class on-screen.  Typically, this would be a statement which
## does not end in a semicolon to suppress output.  For example:
##
## @example
## myobj = myclass (@dots{})
## @end example
##
## User-defined classes should overload the @code{display} method so that
## something useful is printed for a class object.  Otherwise, Octave will
## report only that the object is an instance of its class.
##
## @example
## @group
## myobj = myclass (@dots{})
##   @result{} myobj = <class myclass>
## @end group
## @end example
##
## @seealso{class, subsref, subsasgn}
## @end deftypefn

function display (obj)

  if (nargin != 1)
    print_usage ();
  endif

  ## Only reason we got here is that there was no overloaded display function.
  ## Rely on built-in functions to display whatever obj is.

  varname = inputname (1);
  if (! isempty (varname))
    evalin ("caller", varname);
  else
    disp (obj);
  endif
