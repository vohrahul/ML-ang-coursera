B.1 Test Functions
==================

 -- : test NAME
 -- : test NAME quiet|normal|verbose
 -- : test ("NAME", "quiet|normal|verbose", FID)
 -- : test ("NAME", "quiet|normal|verbose", FNAME)
 -- : SUCCESS = test (...)
 -- : [N, NMAX, NXFAIL, NSKIP] = test (...)
 -- : [CODE, IDX] = test ("NAME", "grabdemo")
 -- : test ([], "explain", FID)
 -- : test ([], "explain", FNAME)

     Perform built-in self-tests from the first file in the loadpath
     matching NAME.

     ‘test’ can be called in either command or functional form.  The
     exact operation of test is determined by a combination of mode
     (interactive or batch), reporting level ("quiet", "normal",
     "verbose"), and whether a logfile or summary output variable is
     used.

     The default mode when ‘test’ is called from the command line is
     interactive.  In this mode, tests will be run until the first error
     is encountered, or all tests complete successfully.  In batch mode,
     all tests are run regardless of any failures, and the results are
     collected for reporting.  Tests which require user interaction,
     i.e., demo blocks, are never run in batch mode.

     Batch mode is enabled by either 1) specifying a logfile using the
     third argument FNAME or FID, or 2) requesting an output argument
     such as SUCCESS, N, etc.

     The optional second argument determines the amount of output to
     generate and which types of tests to run.  The default value is
     "normal".  Requesting an output argument will suppress printing the
     final summary message and any intermediate warnings, unless verbose
     reporting is enabled.

     "quiet"
          Print a summary message when all tests pass, or print an error
          with the results of the first bad test when a failure occurs.
          Don’t run tests which require user interaction.

     "normal"
          Display warning messages about skipped tests or failing xtests
          during test execution.  Print a summary message when all tests
          pass, or print an error with the results of the first bad test
          when a failure occurs.  Don’t run tests which require user
          interaction.

     "verbose"
          Display tests before execution.  Print all warning messages.
          In interactive mode, run all tests including those which
          require user interaction.

     The optional third input argument specifies a logfile where results
     of the tests should be written.  The logfile may be a character
     string (FNAME) or an open file descriptor ID (FID).  To enable
     batch processing, but still print the results to the screen, use
     ‘stdout’ for FID.

     When called with just a single output argument SUCCESS, ‘test’
     returns true if all of the tests were successful.  If called with
     more than one output argument then the number of successful tests
     (N), the total number of tests in the file (NMAX), the number of
     xtest failures (NXFAIL), and the number of skipped tests (NSKIP)
     are returned.

     Example

          test sind
          ⇒
          PASSES 5 out of 5 tests

          [n, nmax] = test ("sind")
          ⇒
          n =  5
          nmax =  5

     Additional Calling Syntaxes

     If the second argument is the string "grabdemo", the contents of
     any built-in demo blocks are extracted but not executed.  The text
     for all code blocks is concatenated and returned as CODE with IDX
     being a vector of positions of the ends of each demo block.  For an
     easier way to extract demo blocks from files, *Note example:
     XREFexample.

     If the second argument is "explain" then NAME is ignored and an
     explanation of the line markers used in ‘test’ output reports is
     written to the file specified by FNAME or FID.

     See also: *note assert: XREFassert, *note fail: XREFfail, *note
     demo: XREFdemo, *note example: XREFexample, *note error: XREFerror.

   ‘test’ scans the named script file looking for lines which start with
the identifier ‘%!’.  The prefix is stripped off and the rest of the
line is processed through the Octave interpreter.  If the code generates
an error, then the test is said to fail.

   Since ‘eval()’ will stop at the first error it encounters, you must
divide your tests up into blocks, with anything in a separate block
evaluated separately.  Blocks are introduced by valid keywords like
‘test’, ‘function’, or ‘assert’ immediately following ‘%!’.  A block is
defined by indentation as in Python.  Lines beginning with
‘%!<whitespace>’ are part of the preceeding block.

   For example:

     %!test error ("this test fails!")
     %!test "test doesn't fail.  it doesn't generate an error"

   When a test fails, you will see something like:

       ***** test error ("this test fails!")
     !!!!! test failed
     this test fails!

   Generally, to test if something works, you want to assert that it
produces a correct value.  A real test might look something like

     %!test
     %! A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]; B = [1; 2];
     %! expect = [ A ; 2*A ];
     %! get = kron (B, A);
     %! if (any (size (expect) != size (get)))
     %!   error ("wrong size: expected %d,%d but got %d,%d",
     %!          size (expect), size (get));
     %! elseif (any (any (expect != get)))
     %!   error ("didn't get what was expected.");
     %! endif

   To make the process easier, use the ‘assert’ function.  For example,
with ‘assert’ the previous test is reduced to:

     %!test
     %! A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]; B = [1; 2];
     %! assert (kron (B, A), [ A; 2*A ]);

   ‘assert’ can accept a tolerance so that you can compare results
absolutely or relatively.  For example, the following all succeed:

     %!test assert (1+eps, 1, 2*eps)           # absolute error
     %!test assert (100+100*eps, 100, -2*eps)  # relative error

   You can also do the comparison yourself, but still have assert
generate the error:

     %!test assert (isempty ([]))
     %!test assert ([1, 2; 3, 4] > 0)

   Because ‘assert’ is so frequently used alone in a test block, there
is a shorthand form:

     %!assert (...)

which is equivalent to:

     %!test assert (...)

   Occasionally a block of tests will depend on having optional
functionality in Octave.  Before testing such blocks the availability of
the required functionality must be checked.  A ‘%!testif HAVE_XXX’ block
will only be run if Octave was compiled with functionality ‘HAVE_XXX’.
For example, the sparse single value decomposition, ‘svds()’, depends on
having the ARPACK library.  All of the tests for ‘svds’ begin with

     %!testif HAVE_ARPACK

Review ‘config.h’ or ‘__octave_config_info__ ("build_features")’ to see
some of the possible values to check.

   Sometimes during development there is a test that should work but is
known to fail.  You still want to leave the test in because when the
final code is ready the test should pass, but you may not be able to fix
it immediately.  To avoid unnecessary bug reports for these known
failures, mark the block with ‘xtest’ rather than ‘test’:

     %!xtest assert (1==0)
     %!xtest fail ("success=1", "error")

In this case, the test will run and any failure will be reported.
However, testing is not aborted and subsequent test blocks will be
processed normally.  Another use of ‘xtest’ is for statistical tests
which should pass most of the time but are known to fail occasionally.

   Each block is evaluated in its own function environment, which means
that variables defined in one block are not automatically shared with
other blocks.  If you do want to share variables, then you must declare
them as ‘shared’ before you use them.  For example, the following
declares the variable A, gives it an initial value (default is empty),
and then uses it in several subsequent tests.

     %!shared A
     %! A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];
     %!assert (kron ([1; 2], A), [ A; 2*A ])
     %!assert (kron ([1, 2], A), [ A, 2*A ])
     %!assert (kron ([1,2; 3,4], A), [ A,2*A; 3*A,4*A ])

   You can share several variables at the same time:

     %!shared A, B

   You can also share test functions:

     %!function A = fn (B)
     %!  A = 2*B;
     %!endfunction
     %!assert (fn(2), 4)

   Note that all previous variables and values are lost when a new
shared block is declared.

   Remember that ‘%!function’ begins a new block and that
‘%!endfunction’ ends this block.  Be aware that until a new block is
started, lines starting with ‘%!<space>’ will be discarded as comments.
The following is nearly identical to the example above, but does
nothing.

     %!function A = fn (B)
     %!  A = 2*B;
     %!endfunction
     %!assert (fn(2), 4)

Because there is a space after ‘%!’ the ‘assert’ statement does not
begin a new block and this line is treated as a comment.

   Error and warning blocks are like test blocks, but they only succeed
if the code generates an error.  You can check the text of the error is
correct using an optional regular expression ‘<pattern>’.  For example:

     %!error <passes!> error ("this test passes!")

   If the code doesn’t generate an error, the test fails.  For example:

     %!error "this is an error because it succeeds."

produces

       ***** error "this is an error because it succeeds."
     !!!!! test failed: no error

   It is important to automate the tests as much as possible, however
some tests require user interaction.  These can be isolated into demo
blocks, which if you are in batch mode, are only run when called with
‘demo’ or the ‘verbose’ option to ‘test’.  The code is displayed before
it is executed.  For example,

     %!demo
     %! T = [0:0.01:2*pi]; X = sin (T);
     %! plot (T, X);
     %! # you should now see a sine wave in your figure window

produces

     funcname example 1:
      T = [0:0.01:2*pi]; X = sin (T);
      plot (T, X);
      # you should now see a sine wave in your figure window

     Press <enter> to continue:

   Note that demo blocks cannot use any shared variables.  This is so
that they can be executed by themselves, ignoring all other tests.

   If you want to temporarily disable a test block, put ‘#’ in place of
the block type.  This creates a comment block which is echoed in the log
file but not executed.  For example:

     %!#demo
     %! T = [0:0.01:2*pi]; X = sin (T);
     %! plot (T, X);
     %! # you should now see a sine wave in your figure window

The following trivial code snippet provides examples for the use of
fail, assert, error, and xtest:

     function output = must_be_zero (INPUT)
       if (INPUT != 0)
         error ("Nonzero input!")
       endif
       output = input;
     endfunction

     %!fail ("must_be_zero (1)")
     %!assert (must_be_zero (0), 0)
     %!error <Nonzero> must_be_zero (1)
     %!xtest error ("This code generates an error")

When putting this in a file ‘must_be_zero.m’, and running the test, we
see

     test must_be_zero verbose

     ⇒
     >>>>> /path/to/must_be_zero.m
     ***** fail ("must_be_zero (1)")
     ***** assert (must_be_zero (0), 0)
     ***** error <Nonzero> must_be_zero (1)
     ***** xtest error ("This code generates an error")
     !!!!! known failure
     This code generates an error
     PASSES 3 out of 4 tests (1 expected failure)

Block type summary:
...................

‘%!test’
‘%!test <MESSAGE>’
     Check that entire block is correct.  If ‘<MESSAGE>’ is present, the
     test block is interpreted as for ‘xtest’.

‘%!testif HAVE_XXX’
‘%!testif HAVE_XXX, HAVE_YYY, ...’
‘%!testif ... <MESSAGE>’
     Check block only if Octave was compiled with feature HAVE_XXX. If
     ‘<MESSAGE>’ is present, the test block is interpreted as for
     ‘xtest’.

‘%!xtest’
‘%!xtest <MESSAGE>’
     Check block, report a test failure but do not abort testing.  If
     ‘<MESSAGE>’ is present, then the text of the message is displayed
     if the test fails, like this:

          !!!!! Known bug:  MESSAGE

     If the message is an integer, it is interpreted as a bug ID for the
     Octave bug tracker and reported as

          !!!!! Known bug: http://octave.org/testfailure/?BUG-ID

     in which BUG-ID is the integer bug number.  The intent is to allow
     clearer documentation of known problems.

‘%!error’
‘%!error <MESSAGE>’
‘%!warning’
‘%!warning <MESSAGE>’
     Check for correct error or warning message.  If ‘<MESSAGE>’ is
     supplied it is interpreted as a regular expression pattern that is
     expected to match the error or warning message.

‘%!demo’
     Demo only executes in interactive mode.

‘%!#’
     Comment.  Ignore everything within the block

‘%!shared x,y,z’
     Declare variables for use in multiple tests.

‘%!function’
     Define a function for use in multiple tests.

‘%!endfunction’
     Close a function definition.

‘%!assert (x, y, tol)’
‘%!assert <MESSAGE> (x, y, tol)’
‘%!fail (CODE, PATTERN)’
‘%!fail <MESSAGE> (CODE, PATTERN)’
     Shorthand for ‘%!test assert (x, y, tol)’ or ‘%!test fail (CODE,
     PATTERN)’.  If ‘<MESSAGE>’ is present, the test block is
     interpreted as for ‘xtest’.

   When coding tests the Octave convention is that lines that begin with
a block type do not have a semicolon at the end.  Any code that is
within a block, however, is normal Octave code and usually will have a
trailing semicolon.  For example,

     ## bare block instantiation
     %!assert (sin (0), 0)

but

     ## test block with normal Octave code
     %!test
     %! assert (sin (0), 0);

   You can also create test scripts for built-in functions and your own
C++ functions.  To do so, put a file with the bare function name (no .m
extension) in a directory in the load path and it will be discovered by
the ‘test’ function.  Alternatively, you can embed tests directly in
your C++ code:

     /*
     %!test disp ("this is a test")
     */

or

     #if 0
     %!test disp ("this is a test")
     #endif

However, in this case the raw source code will need to be on the load
path and the user will have to remember to type ‘test ("funcname.cc")’.

 -- : assert (COND)
 -- : assert (COND, ERRMSG)
 -- : assert (COND, ERRMSG, ...)
 -- : assert (COND, MSG_ID, ERRMSG, ...)
 -- : assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED)
 -- : assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED, TOL)

     Produce an error if the specified condition is not met.

     ‘assert’ can be called in three different ways.

     ‘assert (COND)’
     ‘assert (COND, ERRMSG)’
     ‘assert (COND, ERRMSG, ...)’
     ‘assert (COND, MSG_ID, ERRMSG, ...)’
          Called with a single argument COND, ‘assert’ produces an error
          if COND is false (numeric zero).

          Any additional arguments are passed to the ‘error’ function
          for processing.

     ‘assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED)’
          Produce an error if observed is not the same as expected.

          Note that OBSERVED and EXPECTED can be scalars, vectors,
          matrices, strings, cell arrays, or structures.

     ‘assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED, TOL)’
          Produce an error if observed is not the same as expected but
          equality comparison for numeric data uses a tolerance TOL.

          If TOL is positive then it is an absolute tolerance which will
          produce an error if ‘abs (OBSERVED - EXPECTED) > abs (TOL)’.

          If TOL is negative then it is a relative tolerance which will
          produce an error if ‘abs (OBSERVED - EXPECTED) > abs (TOL *
          EXPECTED)’.

          If EXPECTED is zero TOL will always be interpreted as an
          absolute tolerance.

          If TOL is not scalar its dimensions must agree with those of
          OBSERVED and EXPECTED and tests are performed on an
          element-by-element basis.

     XREFerror, *note isequal: XREFisequal.

 -- : fail (CODE)
 -- : fail (CODE, PATTERN)
 -- : fail (CODE, "warning")
 -- : fail (CODE, "warning", PATTERN)

     Return true if CODE fails with an error message matching PATTERN,
     otherwise produce an error.

     CODE must be in the form of a string that is passed to the Octave
     interpreter via the ‘evalin’ function, i.e., a (quoted) string
     constant or a string variable.

     Note that if CODE runs successfully, rather than failing, the error
     printed is:

                    expected error <.> but got none

     If called with two arguments, the return value will be true only if
     CODE fails with an error message containing PATTERN (case
     sensitive).  If the code fails with a different error than the one
     specified in PATTERN then the message produced is:

                    expected <PATTERN>
                    but got <text of actual error>

     The angle brackets are not part of the output.

     When called with the "warning" option ‘fail’ will produce an error
     if executing the code produces no warning.

B.2 Demonstration Functions
===========================

 -- : demo NAME
 -- : demo NAME N
 -- : demo ("NAME")
 -- : demo ("NAME", N)

     Run example code block N associated with the function NAME.

     If N is not specified, all examples are run.

     The preferred location for example code blocks is embedded within
     the script m-file immediately following the code that it exercises.
     Alternatively, the examples may be stored in a file with the same
     name but no extension located on Octave’s load path.  To separate
     examples from regular script code all lines are prefixed by ‘%!’.
     Each example must also be introduced by the keyword "demo" flush
     left to the prefix with no intervening spaces.  The remainder of
     the example can contain arbitrary Octave code.  For example:

          %!demo
          %! t = 0:0.01:2*pi;
          %! x = sin (t);
          %! plot (t, x);
          %! title ("one cycle of a sine wave");
          %! #-------------------------------------------------
          %! # the figure window shows one cycle of a sine wave

     Note that the code is displayed before it is executed so that a
     simple comment at the end suffices for labeling what is being
     shown.  For plots, labeling can also be done with ‘title’ or
     ‘text’.  It is generally *not* necessary to use ‘disp’ or ‘printf’
     within the demo.

     Demos are run in a stand-alone function environment with no access
     to external variables.  This means that every demo must have
     separate initialization code.  Alternatively, all demos can be
     combined into a single large demo with the code

          %! input ("Press <enter> to continue: ", "s");

     between the sections, but this usage is discouraged.  Other
     techniques to avoid multiple initialization blocks include using
     multiple plots with a new ‘figure’ command between each plot, or
     using ‘subplot’ to put multiple plots in the same window.

     Finally, because ‘demo’ evaluates within a function context it is
     not possible to define new functions within the code.  Anonymous
     functions make a good substitute in most instances.  If function
     blocks *must* be used then the code ‘eval (example ("function",
     n))’ will allow Octave to see them.  This has its own problems,
     however, as ‘eval’ only evaluates one line or statement at a time.
     In this case the function declaration must be wrapped with "if 1
     <demo stuff> endif" where "if" is on the same line as "demo".  For
     example:

          %!demo if 1
          %!  function y = f(x)
          %!    y = x;
          %!  endfunction
          %!  f(3)
          %! endif

     See also: *note rundemos: XREFrundemos, *note example: XREFexample,
     *note test: XREFtest.

 -- : example NAME
 -- : example NAME N
 -- : example ("NAME")
 -- : example ("NAME", N)
 -- : [S, IDX] = example (...)

     Display the code for example N associated with the function NAME,
     but do not run it.

     If N is not specified, all examples are displayed.

     When called with output arguments, the examples are returned in the
     form of a string S, with IDX indicating the ending position of the
     various examples.

     See ‘demo’ for a complete explanation.

     See also: *note demo: XREFdemo, *note test: XREFtest.

 -- : rundemos ()
 -- : rundemos (DIRECTORY)
     Execute built-in demos for all m-files in the specified DIRECTORY.

     Demo blocks in any C++ source files (‘*.cc’) will also be executed
     for use with dynamically linked oct-file functions.

     If no directory is specified, operate on all directories in
     Octave’s search path for functions.

     See also: *note demo: XREFdemo, *note runtests: XREFruntests, *note
     path: XREFpath.

 -- : runtests ()
 -- : runtests (DIRECTORY)
     Execute built-in tests for all m-files in the specified DIRECTORY.

     Test blocks in any C++ source files (‘*.cc’) will also be executed
     for use with dynamically linked oct-file functions.

     If no directory is specified, operate on all directories in
     Octave’s search path for functions.

     See also: *note rundemos: XREFrundemos, *note test: XREFtest, *note
     path: XREFpath.

 -- : speed (F, INIT, MAX_N, F2, TOL)
 -- : [ORDER, N, T_F, T_F2] = speed (...)

     Determine the execution time of an expression (F) for various input
     values (N).

     The N are log-spaced from 1 to MAX_N.  For each N, an
     initialization expression (INIT) is computed to create any data
     needed for the test.  If a second expression (F2) is given then the
     execution times of the two expressions are compared.  When called
     without output arguments the results are printed to stdout and
     displayed graphically.

     ‘F’
          The code expression to evaluate.

     ‘MAX_N’
          The maximum test length to run.  The default value is 100.
          Alternatively, use ‘[min_n, max_n]’ or specify the N exactly
          with ‘[n1, n2, ..., nk]’.

     ‘INIT’
          Initialization expression for function argument values.  Use K
          for the test number and N for the size of the test.  This
          should compute values for all variables used by F.  Note that
          INIT will be evaluated first for k = 0, so things which are
          constant throughout the test series can be computed once.  The
          default value is ‘X = randn (N, 1)’.

     ‘F2’
          An alternative expression to evaluate, so that the speed of
          two expressions can be directly compared.  The default is
          ‘[]’.

     ‘TOL’
          Tolerance used to compare the results of expression F and
          expression F2.  If TOL is positive, the tolerance is an
          absolute one.  If TOL is negative, the tolerance is a relative
          one.  The default is ‘eps’.  If TOL is ‘Inf’, then no
          comparison will be made.

     ‘ORDER’
          The time complexity of the expression O(a*n^p).  This is a
          structure with fields ‘a’ and ‘p’.

     ‘N’
          The values N for which the expression was calculated *AND* the
          execution time was greater than zero.

     ‘T_F’
          The nonzero execution times recorded for the expression F in
          seconds.

     ‘T_F2’
          The nonzero execution times recorded for the expression F2 in
          seconds.  If required, the mean time ratio is simply ‘mean
          (T_f ./ T_f2)’.

     The slope of the execution time graph shows the approximate power
     of the asymptotic running time O(n^p).  This power is plotted for
     the region over which it is approximated (the latter half of the
     graph).  The estimated power is not very accurate, but should be
     sufficient to determine the general order of an algorithm.  It
     should indicate if, for example, the implementation is unexpectedly
     O(n^2) rather than O(n) because it extends a vector each time
     through the loop rather than pre-allocating storage.  In the
     current version of Octave, the following is not the expected O(n).

          speed ("for i = 1:n, y{i} = x(i); endfor", "", [1000, 10000])

     But it is if you preallocate the cell array ‘y’:

          speed ("for i = 1:n, y{i} = x(i); endfor", ...
                 "x = rand (n, 1); y = cell (size (x));", [1000, 10000])

     An attempt is made to approximate the cost of individual
     operations, but it is wildly inaccurate.  You can improve the
     stability somewhat by doing more work for each ‘n’.  For example:

          speed ("airy(x)", "x = rand (n, 10)", [10000, 100000])

     When comparing two different expressions (F, F2), the slope of the
     line on the speedup ratio graph should be larger than 1 if the new
     expression is faster.  Better algorithms have a shallow slope.
     Generally, vectorizing an algorithm will not change the slope of
     the execution time graph, but will shift it relative to the
     original.  For example:

          speed ("sum (x)", "", [10000, 100000], ...
                 "v = 0; for i = 1:length (x), v += x(i); endfor")

     The following is a more complex example.  If there was an original
     version of ‘xcorr’ using for loops and a second version using an
     FFT, then one could compare the run speed for various lags as
     follows, or for a fixed lag with varying vector lengths as follows:

          speed ("xcorr (x, n)", "x = rand (128, 1);", 100,
                 "xcorr_orig (x, n)", -100*eps)
          speed ("xcorr (x, 15)", "x = rand (20+n, 1);", 100,
                 "xcorr_orig (x, n)", -100*eps)

     Assuming one of the two versions is in xcorr_orig, this would
     compare their speed and their output values.  Note that the FFT
     version is not exact, so one must specify an acceptable tolerance
     on the comparison ‘100*eps’.  In this case, the comparison should
     be computed relatively, as ‘abs ((X - Y) ./ Y)’ rather than
     absolutely as ‘abs (X - Y)’.

     Type ‘example ("speed")’ to see some real examples or ‘demo
     ("speed")’ to run them.

Appendix C Obsolete Functions
*****************************

After being marked as deprecated for two major releases, the following
functions have been removed from Octave.  The third column of the table
shows the version of Octave in which the function was removed.  Prior to
removal, each function in the list was marked as deprecated for at least
two major releases.  All deprecated functions issue warnings explaining
that they will be removed in a future version of Octave, and which
function should be used instead.

   Replacement functions do not always accept precisely the same
arguments as the obsolete function, but should provide equivalent
functionality.

Appendix D Known Causes of Trouble
**********************************

This section describes known problems that affect users of Octave.  Most
of these are not Octave bugs per se—if they were, we would fix them.
But the result for a user may be like the result of a bug.

   Some of these problems are due to bugs in other software, some are
missing features that are too much work to add, and some are places
where people’s opinions differ as to what is best.

D.1 Actual Bugs We Haven’t Fixed Yet
====================================

   • Output that comes directly from Fortran functions is not sent
     through the pager and may appear out of sequence with other output
     that is sent through the pager.  One way to avoid this is to force
     pending output to be flushed before calling a function that will
     produce output from within Fortran functions.  To do this, use the
     command

          fflush (stdout)

     Another possible workaround is to use the command

          page_screen_output (false);

     to turn the pager off.

   A list of ideas for future enhancements is distributed with Octave.
See the file ‘PROJECTS’ in the top level directory in the source
distribution.

D.2 Reporting Bugs
==================

Your bug reports play an essential role in making Octave reliable.

   When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it
is already known.  *Note Trouble::.  If it isn’t known, then you should
report the problem.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  In any case, the principal function of a bug report is
to help the entire community by making the next version of Octave work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of Octave.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that makes it possible to fix the bug.

D.2.1 Have You Found a Bug?
---------------------------

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   • If Octave gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that is a
     bug.  Reliable interpreters never crash.

   • If Octave produces incorrect results, for any input whatever, that
     is a bug.

   • Some output may appear to be incorrect when it is in fact due to a
     program whose behavior is undefined, which happened by chance to
     give the desired results on another system.  For example, the range
     operator may produce different results because of differences in
     the way floating point arithmetic is handled on various systems.

   • If Octave produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

   • If Octave does not produce an error message for invalid input, that
     is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of “invalid
     input” might be my idea of “an extension” or “support for
     traditional practice”.

   • If you are an experienced user of programs like Octave, your
     suggestions for improvement are welcome in any case.

D.2.2 Where to Report Bugs
--------------------------

To report a bug in Octave, submit a bug report to the Octave bug tracker
<http://bugs.octave.org>.

   *Do not send bug reports to ‘help-octave’*.  Most users of Octave do
not want to receive bug reports.


File: octave.info,  Node: Bug Reporting,  Next: Sending Patches,  Prev: Bug Tracker,  Up: Reporting Bugs

D.2.3 How to Report Bugs
------------------------

Submit bug reports for Octave to the Octave bug tracker
<http://bugs.octave.org>.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this: *report
all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or leave it
out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and they conclude that some details don’t matter.  Thus, you
might assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does
not matter.  Well, probably it doesn’t, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps
the bug is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the
location where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were
different, the contents of that location would fool the interpreter into
doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known.  Always write your bug reports on the
assumption that the bug is not known.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, “Does this ring a
bell?” This cannot help us fix a bug.  It is better to send a complete
bug report to begin with.

   Try to make your bug report self-contained.  If we have to ask you
for more information, it is best if you include all the previous
information in your response, as well as the information that was
missing.

   To enable someone to investigate the bug, you should include all
these things:

   • The version of Octave.  You can get this by noting the version
     number that is printed when Octave starts, or running it with the
     ‘-v’ option.

   • A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.

     A single statement may not be enough of an example—the bug might
     depend on other details that are missing from the single statement
     where the error finally occurs.

   • The command arguments you gave Octave to execute that example and
     observe the bug.  To guarantee you won’t omit something important,
     list all the options.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we would not encounter the bug.

   • The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   • The command-line arguments you gave to the ‘configure’ command when
     you installed the interpreter.

   • A complete list of any modifications you have made to the
     interpreter source.

     Be precise about these changes—show a context diff for them.

   • Details of any other deviations from the standard procedure for
     installing Octave.

   • A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "The interpreter gets a fatal signal," or,
     "The output produced at line 208 is incorrect."

     Of course, if the bug is that the interpreter gets a fatal signal,
     then one can’t miss it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of the interpreter is out of sync, or you have
     encountered a bug in the C library on your system.  Your copy might
     crash and the copy here would not.  If you said to expect a crash,
     then when the interpreter here fails to crash, we would know that
     the bug was not happening.  If you don’t say to expect a crash,
     then we would not know whether the bug was happening.  We would not
     be able to draw any conclusion from our observations.

     Often the observed symptom is incorrect output when your program is
     run.  Unfortunately, this is not enough information unless the
     program is short and simple.  It is very helpful if you can include
     an explanation of the expected output, and why the actual output is
     incorrect.

   • If you wish to suggest changes to the Octave source, send them as
     context diffs.  If you even discuss something in the Octave source,
     refer to it by context, not by line number, because the line
     numbers in the development sources probably won’t match those in
     your sources.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   • A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.  Such information is usually not
     necessary to enable us to fix bugs in Octave, but if you can find a
     simpler example to report _instead_ of the original one, that is a
     convenience.  Errors in the output will be easier to spot, running
     under the debugger will take less time, etc.  Most Octave bugs
     involve just one function, so the most straightforward way to
     simplify an example is to delete all the function definitions
     except the one in which the bug occurs.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you don’t want to do this,
     report the bug anyway and send the entire test case you used.

   • A patch for the bug.  Patches can be helpful, but if you find a
     bug, you should report it, even if you cannot send a fix for the
     problem.

D.2.4 Sending Patches for Octave
--------------------------------

If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for Octave, that is
very helpful.  When you send your changes, please follow these
guidelines to avoid causing extra work for us in studying the patches.

   If you don’t follow these guidelines, your information might still be
useful, but using it will take extra work.  Maintaining Octave is a lot
of work in the best of circumstances, and we can’t keep up unless you do
your best to help.

   • Send an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or
     what improvement they bring about.  For a bug fix, just include a
     copy of the bug report, and explain why the change fixes the bug.

   • Always include a proper bug report for the problem you think you
     have fixed.  We need to convince ourselves that the change is right
     before installing it.  Even if it is right, we might have trouble
     judging it if we don’t have a way to reproduce the problem.

   • Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people
     reading the source in the future understand why this change was
     needed.

   • Don’t mix together changes made for different reasons.  Send them
     _individually_.

     If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not
     want to install them both.  We might want to install just one.

   • Use ‘diff -c’ to make your diffs.  Diffs without context are hard
     for us to install reliably.  More than that, they make it hard for
     us to study the diffs to decide whether we want to install them.
     Unified diff format is better than contextless diffs, but not as
     easy to read as ‘-c’ format.

     If you have GNU diff, use ‘diff -cp’, which shows the name of the
     function that each change occurs in.

   • Write the change log entries for your changes.

     Read the ‘ChangeLog’ file to see what sorts of information to put
     in, and to learn the style that we use.  The purpose of the change
     log is to show people where to find what was changed.  So you need
     to be specific about what functions you changed; in large
     functions, it’s often helpful to indicate where within the function
     the change was made.

     On the other hand, once you have shown people where to find the
     change, you need not explain its purpose.  Thus, if you add a new
     function, all you need to say about it is that it is new.  If you
     feel that the purpose needs explaining, it probably does—but the
     explanation will be much more useful if you put it in comments in
     the code.

     If you would like your name to appear in the header line for who
     made the change, send us the header line.

D.4 How to Distinguish Between Octave and Matlab
================================================

Octave and MATLAB are very similar, but handle Java slightly different.
Therefore it may be necessary to detect the environment and use the
appropriate functions.  The following function can be used to detect the
environment.  Due to the persistent variable it can be called repeatedly
without a heavy performance hit.

   Example:

     %%
     %% Return: true if the environment is Octave.
     %%
     function retval = isOctave
       persistent cacheval;  % speeds up repeated calls

       if isempty (cacheval)
         cacheval = (exist ("OCTAVE_VERSION", "builtin") > 0);
       end

       retval = cacheval;
     end

Appendix E Installing Octave
****************************

The procedure for installing Octave from source on a Unix-like system is
described next.  Building on other platforms will follow similar steps.
Note that this description applies to Octave releases.  Building the
development sources from the Mercurial archive requires additional steps
as described in the development source itself.

* Running Configure and Make::
* Compiling Octave with 64-bit Indexing::
* Installation Problems::


File: octave.info,  Node: Build Dependencies,  Next: Running Configure and Make,  Up: Installation

E.1 Build Dependencies
======================

Octave is a fairly large program with many build dependencies.  You may
be able to find pre-packaged versions of the dependencies distributed as
part of your system, or you may have to build some or all of them
yourself.

* Menu:

* Obtaining the Dependencies Automatically::
* Build Tools::
* External Packages::


File: octave.info,  Node: Obtaining the Dependencies Automatically,  Next: Build Tools,  Up: Build Dependencies

E.1.1 Obtaining the Dependencies Automatically
----------------------------------------------

On some systems you can obtain many of Octave’s build dependencies
automatically.  The commands for doing this vary by system.  Similarly,
the names of pre-compiled packages vary by system and do not always
match exactly the names listed in *note Build Tools:: and *note External
Packages::.

   You will usually need the development version of an external
dependency so that you get the libraries and header files for building
software, not just for running already compiled programs.  These
packages typically have names that end with the suffix ‘-dev’ or
‘-devel’.

   On systems with ‘apt-get’ (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.), you may be able to
install most of the tools and external packages using a command similar
to

     apt-get build-dep octave

The specific package name may be ‘octave3.2’ or ‘octave3.4’.  The set of
required tools and external dependencies does not change frequently, so
it is not important that the version match exactly, but you should use
the most recent one available.

   On systems with ‘yum’ (Fedora, Red Hat, etc.), you may be able to
install most of the tools and external packages using a command similar
to

     yum-builddep octave

The ‘yum-builddep’ utility is part of the ‘yum-utils’ package.

   For either type of system, the package name may include a version
number.  The set of required tools and external dependencies does not
change frequently, so it is not important that the version exactly match
the version you are installing, but you should use the most recent one
available.


File: octave.info,  Node: Build Tools,  Next: External Packages,  Prev: Obtaining the Dependencies Automatically,  Up: Build Dependencies

E.1.2 Build Tools
-----------------

The following tools are required:

C++, C, and Fortran compilers
     The Octave sources are primarily written in C++, but some portions
     are also written in C and Fortran.  The Octave sources are intended
     to be portable.  Recent versions of the GNU compiler collection
     (GCC) should work (<http://gcc.gnu.org>).  If you use GCC, you
     should avoid mixing versions.  For example, be sure that you are
     not using the obsolete ‘g77’ Fortran compiler with modern versions
     of ‘gcc’ and ‘g++’.

GNU Make
     Tool for building software (<http://www.gnu.org/software/make>).
     Octave’s build system requires GNU Make.  Other versions of Make
     will not work.  Fortunately, GNU Make is highly portable and easy
     to install.

AWK, sed, and other Unix utilities
     Basic Unix system utilities are required for building Octave.  All
     will be available with any modern Unix system and also on Windows
     with either Cygwin or MinGW and MSYS.

   Additionally, the following tools may be needed:

Bison
     Parser generator (<http://www.gnu.org/software/bison>).  You will
     need Bison if you modify the ‘oct-parse.yy’ source file or if you
     delete the files that are generated from it.

Flex
     Lexer analyzer (<http://www.gnu.org/software/flex>).  You will need
     Flex if you modify the ‘lex.ll’ source file or if you delete the
     files that are generated from it.

Autoconf
     Package for software configuration
     (<http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf>).  Autoconf is required if
     you modify Octave’s ‘configure.ac’ file or other files that it
     requires.

Automake
     Package for Makefile generation
     (<http://www.gnu.org/software/automake>).  Automake is required if
     you modify Octave’s ‘Makefile.am’ files or other files that they
     depend on.

Libtool
     Package for building software libraries
     (<http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool>).  Libtool is required by
     Automake.

gperf
     Perfect hash function generator
     (<http://www.gnu.org/software/gperf>).  You will need gperf if you
     modify the ‘octave.gperf’ file or if you delete the file that is
     generated from it.

Texinfo
     Package for generating online and print documentation
     (<http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>).  You will need Texinfo to
     build Octave’s documentation or if you modify the documentation
     source files or the docstring of any Octave function.


File: octave.info,  Node: External Packages,  Prev: Build Tools,  Up: Build Dependencies

E.1.3 External Packages
-----------------------

The following external packages are required:

BLAS
     Basic Linear Algebra Subroutine library.  Accelerated BLAS
     libraries such as OpenBLAS (<http://www.openblas.net/>) or ATLAS
     (<http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net>) are recommended for best
     performance.  The reference implementation
     (<http://www.netlib.org/blas>) is slow, unmaintained, and suffers
     from certain bugs in corner case inputs.

LAPACK
     Linear Algebra Package (<http://www.netlib.org/lapack>).

PCRE
     The Perl Compatible Regular Expression library
     (<http://www.pcre.org>).

   The following external package is optional but strongly recommended:

GNU Readline
     Command-line editing library (<www.gnu.org/s/readline>).

   If you wish to build Octave without GNU readline installed, you must
use the ‘--disable-readline’ option when running the configure script.

   The following external software packages are optional but
recommended:

ARPACK
     Library for the solution of large-scale eigenvalue problems
     (<http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/arpack-ng>).  ARPACK is
     required to provide the functions ‘eigs’ and ‘svds’.

cURL
     Library for transferring data with URL syntax
     (<http://curl.haxx.se>).  cURL is required to provide the ‘urlread’
     and ‘urlwrite’ functions and the ‘ftp’ class.

FFTW3
     Library for computing discrete Fourier transforms
     (<http://www.fftw.org>).  FFTW3 is used to provide better
     performance for functions that compute discrete Fourier transforms
     (‘fft’, ‘ifft’, ‘fft2’, etc.)

FLTK
     Portable GUI toolkit (<http://www.fltk.org>).  FLTK is currently
     used to provide windows for Octave’s OpenGL-based graphics
     functions.

fontconfig
     Library for configuring and customizing font access
     (<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig>).
     Fontconfig is used to manage fonts for Octave’s OpenGL-based
     graphics functions.

FreeType
     Portable font engine (<http://www.freetype.org>).  FreeType is used
     to perform font rendering for Octave’s OpenGL-based graphics
     functions.

GLPK
     GNU Linear Programming Kit (<http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk>).
     GPLK is required for the function ‘glpk’.

gl2ps
     OpenGL to PostScript printing library
     (<http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/>).  gl2ps is required for printing
     when using OpenGL-based graphics toolkits (currently either FLTK or
     Qt).

gnuplot
     Interactive graphics program (<http://www.gnuplot.info>).  gnuplot
     is currently the default graphics renderer for Octave.

GraphicsMagick++
     Image processing library (<http://www.graphicsmagick.org>).
     GraphicsMagick++ is used to provide the ‘imread’ and ‘imwrite’
     functions.

HDF5
     Library for manipulating portable data files
     (<http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5>).  HDF5 is required for Octave’s
     ‘load’ and ‘save’ commands to read and write HDF data files.

Java Development Kit
     Java programming language compiler and libraries.  The OpenJDK free
     software implementation is recommended
     (<http://openjdk.java.net/>), although other JDK implementations
     may work.  Java is required to be able to call Java functions from
     within Octave.

LLVM
     Compiler framework, (<http://www.llvm.org>).  LLVM is required for
     Octave’s experimental just-in-time (JIT) compilation for speeding
     up the interpreter.

OpenGL
     API for portable 2-D and 3-D graphics (<http://www.opengl.org>).
     An OpenGL implementation is required to provide Octave’s
     OpenGL-based graphics functions.  Octave’s OpenGL-based graphics
     functions usually outperform the gnuplot-based graphics functions
     because plot data can be rendered directly instead of sending data
     and commands to gnuplot for interpretation and rendering.

Qhull
     Computational geometry library (<http://www.qhull.org>).  Qhull is
     required to provide the functions ‘convhull’, ‘convhulln’,
     ‘delaunay’, ‘delaunayn’, ‘voronoi’, and ‘voronoin’.

QRUPDATE
     QR factorization updating library
     (<http://sourceforge.net/projects/qrupdate>).  QRUPDATE is used to
     provide improved performance for the functions ‘qrdelete’,
     ‘qrinsert’, ‘qrshift’, and ‘qrupdate’.

QScintilla
     Source code highlighter and manipulator; a Qt port of Scintilla
     (<http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/qscintilla>).
     QScintilla is used for syntax highlighting and code completion in
     the GUI.

Qt
     GUI and utility libraries ().  Qt is required for building the GUI.
     It is a large framework, but the only components required are the
     GUI, core, and network modules.

SuiteSparse
     Sparse matrix factorization library
     (<http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse>).
     SuiteSparse is required to provide sparse matrix factorizations and
     solution of linear equations for sparse systems.

zlib
     Data compression library (<http://zlib.net>).  The zlib library is
     required for Octave’s ‘load’ and ‘save’ commands to handle
     compressed data, including MATLAB v5 MAT files.


File: octave.info,  Node: Running Configure and Make,  Next: Compiling Octave with 64-bit Indexing,  Prev: Build Dependencies,  Up: Installation

E.2 Running Configure and Make
==============================

   • Run the shell script ‘configure’.  This will determine the features
     your system has (or doesn’t have) and create a file named
     ‘Makefile’ from each of the files named ‘Makefile.in’.

     Here is a summary of the configure options that are most frequently
     used when building Octave:

     ‘--help’
          Print a summary of the options recognized by the configure
          script.

     ‘--prefix=PREFIX’
          Install Octave in subdirectories below PREFIX.  The default
          value of PREFIX is ‘/usr/local’.

     ‘--srcdir=DIR’
          Look for Octave sources in the directory DIR.

     ‘--enable-64’
          This is an *experimental* option to enable Octave to use
          64-bit integers for array dimensions and indexing on 64-bit
          platforms.  You probably don’t want to use this option unless
          you know what you are doing.  *Note Compiling Octave with
          64-bit Indexing::, for more details about building Octave with
          this option.

     ‘--enable-bounds-check’
          Enable bounds checking for indexing operators in the internal
          array classes.  This option is primarily used for debugging
          Octave.  Building Octave with this option has a negative
          impact on performance and is not recommended for general use.

     ‘--disable-docs’
          Disable building all forms of the documentation (Info, PDF,
          HTML). The default is to build documentation, but your system
          will need functioning Texinfo and TeX installs for this to
          succeed.

     ‘--enable-float-truncate’
          This option allows for truncation of intermediate floating
          point results in calculations.  It is only necessary for
          certain platforms.

     ‘--enable-readline’
          Use the readline library to provide for editing of the command
          line in terminal environments.  This option is on by default.

     ‘--enable-shared’
          Create shared libraries (this is the default).  If you are
          planning to use the dynamic loading features, you will
          probably want to use this option.  It will make your ‘.oct’
          files much smaller and on some systems it may be necessary to
          build shared libraries in order to use dynamically linked
          functions.

          You may also want to build a shared version of ‘libstdc++’, if
          your system doesn’t already have one.

     ‘--enable-dl’
          Use ‘dlopen’ and friends to make Octave capable of dynamically
          linking externally compiled functions (this is the default if
          ‘--enable-shared’ is specified).  This option only works on
          systems that actually have these functions.  If you plan on
          using this feature, you should probably also use
          ‘--enable-shared’ to reduce the size of your ‘.oct’ files.

     ‘--with-blas=<lib>’
          By default, configure looks for the best BLAS matrix libraries
          on your system, including optimized implementations such as
          the free ATLAS 3.0, as well as vendor-tuned libraries.  (The
          use of an optimized BLAS will generally result in
          several-times faster matrix operations.)  Use this option to
          specify a particular BLAS library that Octave should use.

     ‘--with-lapack=<lib>’
          By default, configure looks for the best LAPACK matrix
          libraries on your system, including optimized implementations
          such as the free ATLAS 3.0, as well as vendor-tuned libraries.
          (The use of an optimized LAPACK will generally result in
          several-times faster matrix operations.)  Use this option to
          specify a particular LAPACK library that Octave should use.

     ‘--with-magick=<lib>’
          Select the library to use for image I/O.  The two possible
          values are "GraphicsMagick" (default) or "ImageMagick".

     ‘--with-sepchar=<char>’
          Use <char> as the path separation character.  This option can
          help when running Octave on non-Unix systems.

     ‘--without-amd’
          Don’t use AMD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

     ‘--without-camd’
          Don’t use CAMD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

     ‘--without-colamd’
          Don’t use COLAMD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

     ‘--without-ccolamd’
          Don’t use CCOLAMD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

     ‘--without-cholmod’
          Don’t use CHOLMOD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

     ‘--without-curl’
          Don’t use the cURL library, disable the ftp objects, ‘urlread’
          and ‘urlwrite’ functions.

     ‘--without-cxsparse’
          Don’t use CXSPARSE, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

     ‘--without-fftw3’
          Use the included FFTPACK library for computing Fast Fourier
          Transforms instead of the FFTW3 library.

     ‘--without-fftw3f’
          Use the included FFTPACK library for computing Fast Fourier
          Transforms instead of the FFTW3 library when operating on
          single precision (float) values.

     ‘--without-glpk’
          Don’t use the GLPK library for linear programming.

     ‘--without-hdf5’
          Don’t use the HDF5 library, disable reading and writing of
          HDF5 files.

     ‘--without-opengl’
          Don’t use OpenGL, disable native graphics toolkit for
          plotting.  You will need ‘gnuplot’ installed in order to make
          plots.

     ‘--without-qhull’
          Don’t use Qhull, disable ‘delaunay’, ‘convhull’, and related
          functions.

     ‘--without-qrupdate’

     ‘--without-framework-carbon’
          Don’t use framework Carbon headers, libraries, or specific
          source code even if the configure test succeeds (the default
          is to use Carbon framework if available).  This is a platform
          specific configure option for Mac systems.

     ‘--without-framework-opengl’
          Don’t use framework OpenGL headers, libraries, or specific
          source code even if the configure test succeeds.  If this
          option is given then OpenGL headers and libraries in standard
          system locations are tested (the default value is
          ‘--with-framework-opengl’).  This is a platform specific
          configure option for Mac systems.

     See the file ‘INSTALL’ for more general information about the
     command line options used by configure.  That file also contains
     instructions for compiling in a directory other than the one where
     the source is located.

   • Run make.

     You will need a recent version of GNU Make as Octave relies on
     certain features not generally available in all versions of make.
     Modifying Octave’s makefiles to work with other make programs is
     probably not worth your time; instead, we simply recommend
     installing GNU Make.

     There are currently three options for plotting in Octave: the
     external program gnuplot, the internal graphics engine using OpenGL
     coupled with either FLTK or Qt widgets.  Gnuplot is a
     command-driven interactive function plotting program.

     To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of ‘g++’ or other
     ANSI C++ compiler.  In addition, you will need a Fortran 77
     compiler or ‘f2c’.  If you use ‘f2c’, you will need a script like
     ‘fort77’ that works like a normal Fortran compiler by combining
     ‘f2c’ with your C compiler in a single script.

     If you plan to modify the parser you will also need GNU ‘bison’ and
     ‘flex’.  If you modify the documentation, you will need GNU
     Texinfo.

     GNU Make, ‘gcc’ (and ‘libstdc++’), ‘gnuplot’, ‘bison’, ‘flex’, and
     Texinfo are all available from many anonymous ftp archives.  The
     primary site is <ftp.gnu.org>, but it is often very busy.  A list
     of sites that mirror the software on <ftp.gnu.org> is available by
     anonymous ftp from <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP>.

     Octave requires approximately 1.4 GB of disk storage to unpack and
     compile from source (significantly less, 400 MB, if you don’t
     compile with debugging symbols).  To compile without debugging
     symbols try the command

          make CFLAGS=-O CXXFLAGS=-O LDFLAGS=

     instead of just ‘make’.

   • If you encounter errors while compiling Octave, first see *note
     Installation Problems:: for a list of known problems and if there
     is a workaround or solution for your problem.  If not, see *note
     Trouble:: for information about how to report bugs.

   • Once you have successfully compiled Octave, run ‘make install’.

     This will install a copy of Octave, its libraries, and its
     documentation in the destination directory.  As distributed, Octave
     is installed in the following directories.  In the table below,
     PREFIX defaults to ‘/usr/local’, VERSION stands for the current
     version number of the interpreter, and ARCH is the type of computer
     on which Octave is installed (for example, ‘i586-unknown-gnu’).

     ‘PREFIX/bin’
          Octave and other binaries that people will want to run
          directly.

     ‘PREFIX/lib/octave-VERSION’
          Libraries like liboctave.a and liboctinterp.a.

     ‘PREFIX/octave-VERSION/include/octave’
          Include files distributed with Octave.

     ‘PREFIX/share’
          Architecture-independent data files.

     ‘PREFIX/share/man/man1’
          Unix-style man pages describing Octave.

     ‘PREFIX/share/info’
          Info files describing Octave.

     ‘PREFIX/share/octave/VERSION/m’
          Function files distributed with Octave.  This includes the
          Octave version, so that multiple versions of Octave may be
          installed at the same time.

     ‘PREFIX/libexec/octave/VERSION/exec/ARCH’
          Executables to be run by Octave rather than the user.

     ‘PREFIX/lib/octave/VERSION/oct/ARCH’
          Object files that will be dynamically loaded.

     ‘PREFIX/share/octave/VERSION/imagelib’
          Image files that are distributed with Octave.

E.3 Compiling Octave with 64-bit Indexing
=========================================

Note: the following only applies to systems that have 64-bit pointers.
Configuring Octave with ‘--enable-64’ cannot magically make a 32-bit
system have a 64-bit address space.

   On 64-bit systems, Octave is limited to (approximately) the following
array sizes when using the default 32-bit indexing mode:

     double:         16 GB
     single:          8 GB
     uint64, int64:  16 GB
     uint32, int32:   8 GB
     uint16, int16:   4 GB
     uint8, int8:     2 GB

   In each case, the limit is really (approximately) 2^{31} elements
because of the default type of the value used for indexing arrays
(signed 32-bit integer, corresponding to the size of a Fortran INTEGER
value).

   Trying to create larger arrays will produce the following error:

     octave:1> a = zeros (1024*1024*1024*3, 1, 'int8');
     error: memory exhausted or requested size too large
            for range of Octave's index type --
            trying to return to prompt

You will obtain this error even if your system has enough memory to
create this array (4 GB in the above case).

   To use arrays larger than 2 GB, Octave has to be configured with the
option ‘--enable-64’.  This option is experimental and you are
encouraged to submit bug reports if you find a problem.  With this
option, Octave will use 64-bit integers internally for array dimensions
and indexing.  However, all numerical libraries used by Octave will
*also* need to use 64-bit integers for array dimensions and indexing.
In most cases, this means they will need to be compiled from source
since most (all?)  distributions which package these libraries compile
them with the default Fortran integer size, which is normally 32-bits
wide.

   The following instructions were tested with the development version
of Octave and GCC 4.3.4 on an x86_64 Debian system.

   The versions listed below are the versions used for testing.  If
newer versions of these packages are available, you should try to use
them, although there may be some differences.

   All libraries and header files will be installed in subdirectories of
‘$prefix64’ (you must choose the location of this directory).

   • BLAS and LAPACK (<http://www.netlib.org/lapack>)

     Reference versions for both libraries are included in the reference
     LAPACK 3.2.1 distribution from <netlib.org>.

        − Copy the file ‘make.inc.example’ and name it ‘make.inc’.  The
          options ‘-fdefault-integer-8’ and ‘-fPIC’ (on 64-bit CPU) have
          to be added to the variable ‘OPTS’ and ‘NOOPT’.

        − Once you have compiled this library make sure that you use it
          for compiling Suite Sparse and Octave.  In the following we
          assume that you installed the LAPACK library as
          $prefix64/lib/liblapack.a.

   • QRUPDATE (<http://sourceforge.net/projects/qrupdate>)

     In the ‘Makeconf’ file:

        − Add ‘-fdefault-integer-8’ to ‘FFLAGS’.

        − Adjust the BLAS and LAPACK variables as needed if your 64-bit
          aware BLAS and LAPACK libraries are in a non-standard
          location.

        − Set ‘PREFIX’ to the top-level directory of your install tree.

        − Run ‘make solib’ to make a shared library.

        − Run ‘make install’ to install the library.

   • SuiteSparse (<http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse>)

     Pass the following options to ‘make’ to enable 64-bit integers for
     BLAS library calls.  On 64-bit Windows systems, use
     ‘-DLONGBLAS="long long"’ instead.

          CFLAGS='-DLONGBLAS=long'
          CXXFLAGS='-DLONGBLAS=long'

     The SuiteSparse makefiles don’t generate shared libraries.  On some
     systems, you can generate them by doing something as simple as

          top=$(pwd)
          for f in *.a; do
            mkdir tmp
            cd tmp
            ar vx ../$f
            gcc -shared -o ../${f%%.a}.so *.o
            cd $top
            rm -rf tmp
          done

     Other systems may require a different solution.

   • ARPACK (http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/arpack-ng/)

        − Add ‘-fdefault-integer-8’ to ‘FFLAGS’ when running configure.

        − Run ‘make’ to build the library.

        − Run ‘make install’ to install the library.

   • ATLAS instead of reference BLAS and LAPACK

     Suggestions on how to compile ATLAS would be most welcome.

   • GLPK

   • Qhull (<http://www.qhull.org>)

     Both GLPK and Qhull use ‘int’ internally so maximum problem sizes
     may be limited.

   • Octave

     Octave’s 64-bit index support is activated with the configure
     option ‘--enable-64’.

          ./configure \
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$prefix64/lib" \
            CPPFLAGS="-I$prefix64/include" LDFLAGS="-L$prefix64/lib" \
            --enable-64

     You must ensure that all Fortran sources except those in the
     ‘liboctave/cruft/ranlib’ directory are compiled such that INTEGERS
     are 8-bytes wide.  If you are using gfortran, the configure script
     should automatically set the Makefile variable ‘F77_INTEGER_8_FLAG’
     to ‘-fdefault-integer-8’.  If you are using another compiler, you
     must set this variable yourself.  You should NOT set this flag in
     ‘FFLAGS’, otherwise the files in ‘liboctave/cruft/ranlib’ will be
     miscompiled.

   • Other dependencies

     Probably nothing special needs to be done for the following
     dependencies.  If you discover that something does need to be done,
     please submit a bug report.

        − pcre

        − zlib

        − hdf5

        − fftw3

        − cURL

        − GraphicsMagick++

        − OpenGL

        − freetype

        − fontconfig

        − fltk


File: octave.info,  Node: Installation Problems,  Prev: Compiling Octave with 64-bit Indexing,  Up: Installation

E.4 Installation Problems
=========================

This section contains a list of problems (and some apparent problems
that don’t really mean anything is wrong) that may show up during
installation of Octave.

   • On some SCO systems, ‘info’ fails to compile if ‘HAVE_TERMIOS_H’ is
     defined in ‘config.h’.  Simply removing the definition from
     ‘info/config.h’ should allow it to compile.

   • If ‘configure’ finds ‘dlopen’, ‘dlsym’, ‘dlclose’, and ‘dlerror’,
     but not the header file ‘dlfcn.h’, you need to find the source for
     the header file and install it in the directory ‘usr/include’.
     This is reportedly a problem with Slackware 3.1.  For Linux/GNU
     systems, the source for ‘dlfcn.h’ is in the ‘ldso’ package.

   • Building ‘.oct’ files doesn’t work.

     You should probably have a shared version of ‘libstdc++’.  A patch
     is needed to build shared versions of version 2.7.2 of ‘libstdc++’
     on the HP-PA architecture.  You can find the patch at
     <ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/g++/libg++-2.7.2-hppa-gcc-fix>.

   • On some DEC alpha systems there may be a problem with the ‘libdxml’
     library, resulting in floating point errors and/or segmentation
     faults in the linear algebra routines called by Octave.  If you
     encounter such problems, then you should modify the configure
     script so that ‘SPECIAL_MATH_LIB’ is not set to ‘-ldxml’.

   • On FreeBSD systems Octave may hang while initializing some internal
     constants.  The fix appears to be to use

          options      GPL_MATH_EMULATE

     rather than

          options      MATH_EMULATE

     in the kernel configuration files (typically found in the directory
     ‘/sys/i386/conf’).  After making this change, you’ll need to
     rebuild the kernel, install it, and reboot.

   • If you encounter errors like

          passing `void (*)()' as argument 2 of
            `octave_set_signal_handler(int, void (*)(int))'

     or

          warning: ANSI C++ prohibits conversion from `(int)'
                   to `(...)'

     while compiling ‘sighandlers.cc’, you may need to edit some files
     in the ‘gcc’ include subdirectory to add proper prototypes for
     functions there.  For example, Ultrix 4.2 needs proper declarations
     for the ‘signal’ function and the ‘SIG_IGN’ macro in the file
     ‘signal.h’.

     On some systems the ‘SIG_IGN’ macro is defined to be something like
     this:

          #define  SIG_IGN  (void (*)())1

     when it should really be something like:

          #define  SIG_IGN  (void (*)(int))1

     to match the prototype declaration for the ‘signal’ function.  This
     change should also be made for the ‘SIG_DFL’ and ‘SIG_ERR’ symbols.
     It may be necessary to change the definitions in ‘sys/signal.h’ as
     well.

     The ‘gcc’ ‘fixincludes’ and ‘fixproto’ scripts should probably fix
     these problems when ‘gcc’ installs its modified set of header
     files, but I don’t think that’s been done yet.

     *You should not change the files in ‘/usr/include’*.  You can find
     the ‘gcc’ include directory tree by running the command

          gcc -print-libgcc-file-name

     The directory of ‘gcc’ include files normally begins in the same
     directory that contains the file ‘libgcc.a’.

   • Some of the Fortran subroutines may fail to compile with older
     versions of the Sun Fortran compiler.  If you get errors like

          zgemm.f:
                  zgemm:
          warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
          zgemm.f, line 245: warning: unexpected parent of complex
            expression subtree
          warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
          zgemm.f, line 304: warning: unexpected parent of complex
            expression subtree
          warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
          zgemm.f, line 327: warning: unexpected parent of complex
            expression subtree
          pcc_binval: missing IR_CONV in complex op
          make[2]: *** [zgemm.o] Error 1

     when compiling the Fortran subroutines in the ‘liboctave/cruft’
     subdirectory, you should either upgrade your compiler or try
     compiling with optimization turned off.

   • On NeXT systems, if you get errors like this:

          /usr/tmp/cc007458.s:unknown:Undefined local
                symbol LBB7656
          /usr/tmp/cc007458.s:unknown:Undefined local
                symbol LBE7656

     when compiling ‘Array.cc’ and ‘Matrix.cc’, try recompiling these
     files without ‘-g’.

   • Some people have reported that calls to system() and the pager do
     not work on SunOS systems.  This is apparently due to having
     ‘G_HAVE_SYS_WAIT’ defined to be 0 instead of 1 when compiling
     ‘libg++’.

   • On systems where the reference BLAS library is used the following
     matrix-by-vector multiplication incorrectly handles NaN values of
     the form ‘NaN * 0’.

          [NaN, 1; 0, 0] * [0; 1]
          ⇒
          [ 1
            0 ]

          correct result ⇒
          [ NaN
            0   ]

     Install a different BLAS library such as OpenBLAS or ATLAS to
     correct this issue.

   • On NeXT systems, linking to ‘libsys_s.a’ may fail to resolve the
     following functions

          _tcgetattr
          _tcsetattr
          _tcflow

     which are part of ‘libposix.a’.  Unfortunately, linking Octave with
     ‘-posix’ results in the following undefined symbols.

          .destructors_used
          .constructors_used
          _objc_msgSend
          _NXGetDefaultValue
          _NXRegisterDefaults
          .objc_class_name_NXStringTable
          .objc_class_name_NXBundle

     One kluge around this problem is to extract ‘termios.o’ from
     ‘libposix.a’, put it in Octave’s ‘src’ directory, and add it to the
     list of files to link together in the makefile.  Suggestions for
     better ways to solve this problem are welcome!

   • If Octave crashes immediately with a floating point exception, it
     is likely that it is failing to initialize the IEEE floating point
     values for infinity and NaN.

     If your system actually does support IEEE arithmetic, you should be
     able to fix this problem by modifying the function
     ‘octave_ieee_init’ in the file ‘lo-ieee.cc’ to correctly initialize
     Octave’s internal infinity and NaN variables.

     If your system does not support IEEE arithmetic but Octave’s
     configure script incorrectly determined that it does, you can work
     around the problem by editing the file ‘config.h’ to not define
     ‘HAVE_ISINF’, ‘HAVE_FINITE’, and ‘HAVE_ISNAN’.

     In any case, please report this as a bug since it might be possible
     to modify Octave’s configuration script to automatically determine
     the proper thing to do.

   • If Octave is unable to find a header file because it is installed
     in a location that is not normally searched by the compiler, you
     can add the directory to the include search path by specifying (for
     example) ‘CPPFLAGS=-I/some/nonstandard/directory’ as an argument to
     ‘configure’.  Other variables that can be specified this way are
     ‘CFLAGS’, ‘CXXFLAGS’, ‘FFLAGS’, and ‘LDFLAGS’.  Passing them as
     options to the configure script also records them in the
     ‘config.status’ file.  By default, ‘CPPFLAGS’ and ‘LDFLAGS’ are
     empty, ‘CFLAGS’ and ‘CXXFLAGS’ are set to "-g -O2" and ‘FFLAGS’ is
     set to "-O".

F.2 Parser
==========

The parser has a number of variables that affect its internal operation.
These variables are generally documented in the manual alongside the
code that they affect.  For example, ‘allow_noninteger_range_as_index’
is discussed in the section on index expressions.

   In addition, there are three non-specific parser customization
functions.  ‘add_input_event_hook’ can be used to schedule a user
function for periodic evaluation.  ‘remove_input_event_hook’ will stop a
user function from being evaluated periodically.

 -- : ID = add_input_event_hook (FCN)
 -- : ID = add_input_event_hook (FCN, DATA)
     Add the named function or function handle FCN to the list of
     functions to call periodically when Octave is waiting for input.

     The function should have the form

          FCN (DATA)

     If DATA is omitted, Octave calls the function without any
     arguments.

     The returned identifier may be used to remove the function handle
     from the list of input hook functions.

     See also: *note remove_input_event_hook:
     XREFremove_input_event_hook.

 -- : remove_input_event_hook (NAME)
 -- : remove_input_event_hook (FCN_ID)
     Remove the named function or function handle with the given
     identifier from the list of functions to call periodically when
     Octave is waiting for input.

     See also: *note add_input_event_hook: XREFadd_input_event_hook.

   Finally, when the parser cannot identify an input token it calls a
particular function to handle this.  By default, this is the internal
function "__unimplemented__" which makes suggestions about possible
Octave substitutes for MATLAB functions.

 -- : VAL = missing_function_hook ()
 -- : OLD_VAL = missing_function_hook (NEW_VAL)
 -- : missing_function_hook (NEW_VAL, "local")
     Query or set the internal variable that specifies the function to
     call when an unknown identifier is requested.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the
     variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it
     calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the
     function.

Appendix G GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
*************************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users’ freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
     “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

     To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified
     version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

     A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
     restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor
     version”.

     A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, “control”
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To “grant”
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS”
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
“copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.

   The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an “about box”.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
